         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>And as it is in praiſing God, ſo alſo it is in other workings of the heart towards God, as now grace doth not love God ſo much for what God gives to it, as for what God is himſelf; that is the difference between true ſanctifying grace, and common grace; common grace may make mee love God for what I receive from him, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is the work that now I have to do, to endeavour to preſent God in the excellency of his being to you, onely you muſt by way of caution know before wee do begin, <hi>That God dwells in that light that is unapproachable,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16. That it is but little that wee do, or can know of God. And before wee begin to ſet forth the excellency of Gods being to you, you muſt know, that there is infinitely more than either the tongue of Man or Angel can expreſs; when wee have done all wee can, there is more in God that is beyond what wee can ſay, or Angels could preach unto you; I ſay, more than the glorious light of the Sun is more than a little glittering of a gloe-worm in the night, more than all the Sea is beyond, and above a ſpoonful, a drop of water.</p>
                     <p>And further by way of <hi>Caution, you muſt know this, that it is impoſſible to ſet before you the excellency of Gods being, and yet to ſpeak ſo as every thing ſhould bee plain to every one.</hi> Many things in the opening of Gods Nature to you, muſt needs have ſome difficulty in them, becauſe the ſubject that wee are ſpeaking of, is ſo high above us; eſpecially it muſt needs bee difficult to unclean ſpirits, to ſpirits that have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168883:12"/> alwayes been groveling below in the dirt, to drouſie ſpirits that think nothing to bee excellent, but onely to eat and drink, and ſatisfie their fleſh; when they hear the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Gods Being ſet out unto them, it muſt needs bee an argument above their reach; it cannot bee expected that it is poſſible to ſpeak ſo as their hearts ſhould cloſe with what is ſaid, to apprehend it.</p>
                     <p>But howſoever wee do not know what God may do in going along with his word, how hee may come by his Spirit even to thoſe that are of the weakeſt capacity, therefore I ſhall endeavour to do that that is my work, that is, to ſhew you ſomewhat of God, what an excellent being hee is, and ſo leave the work of the Spirit of God to himſelf, to make known thoſe things that ſhall bee propounded, and to ſettle them upon your hearts. Wherefore then <hi>God is an excellent being above all things.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly (for I intend but meerly to preſent the chief things of the excellency of God before you, and not to ſtand handling of theſe at large, for every one of them might require a large tractate, but now onely to preſent before you what a God it is that you have to deal with) <hi>God is a Being that is All-ſufficient in himſelf;</hi> Hee ſtands in no need of any creature; in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. verſe. Hee hath need of nothing, of none of us, hee hath enough within himſelf; before the world was, God was as bleſſed in himſelf as now hee is; there can bee nothing added to him, there is ſuch an excellency even in Gods being its ſelf, that there can be nothing added to him; wee are poor creatures, that ſtand in need of a thouſand things continually, the air to breathe in, the earth to bear us, fire to warm us, cloaths to cover us, meat and drink, a thouſand things; wee ſtand in need of the meaneſt creature, and if God ſhould take away the uſe of ſome mean contemptible creature, our lives would bee made miſerable to us; but that is the excellency of Gods being that hee hath need of nothing, hee hath all within himſelf, all the creatures in heaven and earth, cannot
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168883:14"/> adde to him; no if there were ten thouſand worlds more, although God did poſſeſs them all, yet they would not adde one whit unto what is in God himſelf; therefore though the Lord hath made the heaven and earth,<note place="margin">God hath an eſſential and an attributed glory, his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted glory is augmented or diminiſhed by mans obedience or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, therefore ſinners are ſaid to rob God of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Saints to give him glory; but his eſſential glory cannot bee increaſed or diminiſhed.</note> and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet wee muſt not think that God is ever a whit the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for theſe things, or hath the more glory; hee had as much glory and bleſſedneſs in himſelf, as now hee hath, or can have; when all the Angels and Saints ſhall bee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bleſſing God in heaven, yet they can adde nothing to Gods glory: Wee ſay the Sun is a glorious creature, but doth that adde any light to the Sun? ſo for Saints and Angels to bee praiſing and bleſſing God, what doth that adde to God? <hi>And in this the Name of God is excellent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 But further, in the fifth place, <hi>His Name alone is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in this thing, that his excellency is univerſal,</hi> that is, all excellencies that are in all creatures in heaven and earth, they are all in him virtually, and eminently, hee hath them all in his own being, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.9. <hi>Shall not hee that made the ear hear, hee that formed the eye ſhall not hee ſee?</hi> the argument there will confirm this to us, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in the creature that hath any excellency in it, that excellency is in God in an eminent way; the creature, one hath one drop of excellency, and another hath another drop of excellency in it, and ſo a third a third, every creature hath its particular excellency in it, but God is an univerſal good, all excellencies in all creatures are in God, all beauty, all comfort, all goodneſs, whatſoever hath any lovelineſs or deſireableneſs in it, I ſay it is all in God, and I know not any one conſideration that will help us more to underſtand God while wee are here in the fleſh than this, for in regard of our weakneſs, wee can know little or nothing of God, but by looking into the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo riſing from them.</p>
                     <p>Now then when wee come to look upon the creatures, and wee ſee an excellency in one creature, and another in another, Now if wee can conceive as it were the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of all theſe excellencies drawn out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Now this indeed wee cannot by ſenſe ſee, the comforts of the creature are ſenſibly before us, and wee ſee them by our ſenſes; but now God is above our ſenſe, God hee is above our reaſon, and there muſt bee faith to cloſe with him; but now when God would convert a ſoul to himſelf, hee doth ſhew himſelf in ſuch a way to the ſoul, as the ſoul doth ſee that there is all good in him that there is in the creature, and that it is in God in a more ſatisfying and eminent manner.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, whatſoever there is in the effect, it muſt needs be in the cauſes; now as all effects are to be reſolved into the cauſes, ſo all cauſes are to bee reſolved into this excellent being, that is the firſt cauſe of all things; for theſe creaures that are effects, they have other cauſes of them, yet thoſe cauſes are effects of ſome higher cauſes, at length wee muſt come to the firſt cauſe, and all muſt bee reſolved into that; nay all excellencies in the creature are more in God, than the excellency of the effect is in its cauſes; for the cauſes when an effect is reſolved into them, the cauſes if they bee not united to produce ſuch an effect, they cannot do immediately that thing that the effect could do; but now all excellency is ſo in God, as look
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:168883:15"/> what power any creature hath, or what thing it can do by any excellency it hath, that God can do; look what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it can bring by any good it hath in it, the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort God can bring; ſo that all is to bee reſolved into God; not that God hath all formally in him, as fire, air, meat, and drink, but what good there is here, what excellency there is here, it is eminently in God, that is, God is able to do of himſelf by his own being, whatſoever any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is able to do, though all the creatures in the world ſhould bee annihilated (taken away) and thou onely let live, God by his immediate power is able to let out to thee all thoſe variety of comforts that all the creatures the world had before could do: Now when wee can finde all made up in God (as we ſay ſometimes, that in ſome one good diſh, there is all diſhes made up (that is but a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude) but here it is really that whatſoever any childe of God loſes in the creature, ſuch a one can finde it to bee made up in God) Indeed this is the art and skill of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Godlineſs doth teach this art and skill, to make up whatſoever is wanting in a creature, in God himſelf, and that is the chief ground of the ſatisfaction and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a gracious heart in the want of creature-comforts; and becauſe the men of the world have no skill in this myſtery, they think it a meer notion, a conceit of men, they are not able to apprehend any reallity in it, therefore it is that they vex and fret ſo much when they want creature-comforts, for they know not whither to go to make them up in any other being: But the Saints know that all is in God, all excellency in all creatures is in God, therefore when you look thus upon God, as having all good that all creatures have, and that in himſelf; and when you come thus to God as ſuch a being ſo much above all creatures, then you have in ſome meaſure a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of God: And that is the fifth thing.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 But ſixthly, <hi>The Name of God is excellent above all:</hi> For not onely all excellencies in the Creature are in him; but all thoſe varieties of excellencies that are ſcattered up and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168883:15"/> down ſeverally in Creatures, are united into one excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in him; for a water may have the quinteſſence of many herbs in it; there are many things in the water at that time; though but one drop of water, yet there are many things in it: So there is ſuch an union of all excellencies in God, that I ſay it is but one in God; there is an indiviſible union of all variety: Things that are various in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are all united in one in God, that muſt needs be a glorious excellency indeed. If one man had all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtrength, and all the wiſdome that all the men in the world ever had, or have, and united into one, what beauty, what ſtrength, what wiſdome would that one man have! now it is ſo in God, that all beauty, and wiſdome, and ſtrength, are united into one excellency, ſo that God he is one otherwiſe than any other Creature can be one; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures may bee made one by compoſition, but now God hee is not one by the union of many things together; for there is but one thing in God, God is but one, there is a variety, as wee conceive, as the Sun when it ſhines upon different glaſſes, red, or blew, or yellow, it hath a variety, I but all this is but one Sun, ſo all the attributes of God that we ſpeak divers times of, theſe are the ſeveral manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that one excellency that there is in God, all united into one; therefore by this the Saints come to be the more happy, for they may not onely enjoy all the good that there is in the Creature, but injoy it all in one, and wee ſay, the ſtronger is a thing, the more it is united; now in God all good whatſoever is united in one, all good in the Creature, yea and all good in himſelf, that is, all his attributes; ſo you muſt conceive of God; onely the manifeſtation is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and therefore you muſt not conceive that there is any one thing in him more than another; you may not conceive of God, as if there were more mercy than juſtice, or more juſtice than mercy, or more of either of theſe, than there is of truth, wiſdome, and holineſs: Indeed God may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf unto the Creature, more in one, than in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as they are in his own beeing they are not, onely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:168883:16"/> one as much as the other, but they are all but one thing, onely ſeveral manifeſtations, as but one Sun that hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reflections by divers glaſſes; ſo all Gods attributes are but one excellency that is in him; therefore his Name is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent above all things, becauſe hee is but one God in this manner.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 <hi>Further, Not onely all good and excellency is in God, but all poſſible good, what can poſſibly bee imagined</hi> (as we know that the power of God that made the world, could make thouſands of worlds) <hi>all this is in him, and infinitely in him,</hi> When wee do ſpeak of any thing to bee in God, wee muſt be ſure that we do not limit our thoughts, as when we ſpeak of God to bee a great God, do not limit it, hee is great, but infinitely ſo; when wee ſpeak of his wiſdome, hee is wiſe, but infinitely wiſe, and ſo of his holineſs, and juſtice, and truth, and knowledge; all muſt bee lookt upon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bounds whatſoever; in the Creature there are ſuch and ſuch things, but they are all limited by their cauſes, but God having no cauſes at all to limit him, therefore hee is infinite, whatſoever is in him it is infinitely in him, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in him, is not onely infinite in the kinde, as there is all the wiſdome and holineſs that can bee; but I ſay, it is abſolutely infinite; as it is in him, it is ſo infinite, that there is no kinde of being but is included within it; ſpeak but any one thing of God, I ſay, it is not onely infinite in the kinde, but ſo as it includes whatſoever hath beeing, in the infinite Ocean of beeing that is in himſelf; wee are very ready when wee look upon God to have limited thoughts, and therein wee bring him down to the Creature; this is the very reaſon why God doth hate Images ſo much as hee doth, becauſe that Images do make a kinde of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of him, as though hee were finite; as Papiſts, they tell us they think not that ſuch an Image is God, I, but being put in mind of God by ſuch an Image, there is a kinde of limiting the infiniteneſs that is in God; and therefore God hates it, and will not have that infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his to bee repreſented by any Image whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;

                     <p n="8">8 Yea and further, All the good that there is in God, and excellency, it is eternally in him; it may bee ſuch a Creature hath an excellency, but how long hath it had it? it was not long before but it was nothing: but God hath been what hee hath been (if wee may ſpeak ſo) hee hath been eternally; now that is a mighty ſwallowing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the conſideration of eternity; as a man that is an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant, if hee writes a figure of one, add but ſix ciphers to it, and it is ten hundred thouſand, now if hee ſhould be adding and adding all his life time, yea if hee ſhould have lived from the beginning of the world to have added to the figure of one, what an infinite ſumme would this bee! but it is nothing to eternity; either if you look back to eternity it is nothing, or if you look forward to eternity, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; (the Saints indeed ſhall live eternally in reſpect of that which is to come, the ſouls and bodies of the Saints ſhall bee eternally for time to come with God, and the ſouls and bodies of the ungodly ſhall bee eternally in Hell) Now all the excellency that there is in God, is eternally in God, which way ſoever you look.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 <hi>Further, Not onely eternally, but immutably in him;</hi> and therefore his name is alone excellent, it is immutable, that is, God hath ſuch an infinite excellency, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that hee can bee better, or other than hee is; if God ſhould bee otherwiſe than hee is, hee would inſtantly ceaſe to bee a God; the beeing of God hath that excellency in it, that there can bee no addition, no ſubſtraction, add any thing to him, and you deſtroy him, take any thing from him, and you deſtroy his beeing, alter any thing in him, and hee ceaſes to bee God; ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>With him

                        <note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> Indeed there is a change in the creature, but nothing at all in God; as if you bring a peece of wax to the Sun it melts it, and clay, it hardens it, here is a different effect of the Sun, but the Sun is the ſame; ſo bring the creature in one diſpoſition to God, and the love of God, and delight of God is in it; bring the creature in another diſpoſition to God, and the wrath of God is upon it, yet God is the ſame, onely the variety is in the creature. <hi>And therefore his Name alone is excellent,</hi> and the creature, whatſoever excellence it hath, it changes up and down: As there is no ſhadow of change with God, ſo no ſhadow of conſtancy in the creature.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Further in the next place, <hi>All theſe things are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in God;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Quicquid eſt in Deo eſt Deus</note> whatſoever is in God, it is his being, its God himſelf: This one thing would much help you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Nature of God, that whatſoever can bee truly ſaid of God, it is God himſelf; as thus, Gods wiſdome is God himſelf; Gods mercy is God himſelf; Gods power is God himſelf: it is not ſo in the creature, a mans wiſdome is not a mans being, they are ſeparable, one may bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the other; but Gods wiſdome is Gods being; a mans power and ſtrength is not his beeing, but Gods is, ſo a mans mercy and goodneſs is not his beeing, but Gods is, and therefore (as before) theſe things that are variouſly conceived by us, they are not onely one in God, but his very beeing, and this doth mightily adde to the glory of God, that whatſoever is in God, it is the very eſſence and beeing of God himſelf: Theſe things that wee ſpeak of God (as I told you) becauſe God is ſo infinitly above us, it is very hard to make them plain to every underſtanding; and no marvel, becauſe wee are fallen ſo far from him; and as I have gone along, I fear that a great many are ready to think, Lord what are theſe things, wee cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them; why then go thy wayes home and bee humbled for that great fall of mankinde, Oh how far is man fallen by his ſin? wee ſee now why God <hi>dwells in the thick cloud and darkneſs:</hi> Oh how far am I fallen from

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168883:20"/> there are not ſeveral acts of Gods will, but Gods act is himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Divers other things might bee ſhewed, as this,</p>
                     <p n="5">5 <hi>Where God hath done any work, all his works adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him.</hi> The creature hath ſomewhat added to him by his works; as thus, A man that is a work-man hee can make a houſe, and ſo hee hath the benefit of it to dwell in, to keep off the weather, and ſo hee makes cloath, and hath the benefit of it: But all the works of God adde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him. A man can do ſomething by the work that hee hath made that hee could not do without his work: but God can do nothing by any work that hee hath made, but hee can do the ſame without that work; when hee hath made all his works, they are not helpful to him (but this was a branch of the All-ſufficiency of God.)</p>
                     <p n="16">16 In the next place, <hi>God alone is excellent in the manner of his communication of himſelf,</hi> God doth ſo communicate himſelf to his creatures, as one creature cannot to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God can let out as much of himſelf as hee will to any creature; now one creature cannot let out as much as hee pleaſes to another; for inſtance, A man that hath learning, hee cannot make another as learned as hee will; a man that hath holineſs and goodneſs, cannot make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as holy, and as good as hee will: but God can, this is Gods propriety, hee can let out of himſelf as much as hee pleaſes, as much holineſs, as much goodneſs, as much power as hee pleaſes hee is able to let out.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the creature, <hi>When it doth communicate any excellency, the more it lets out, the leſs it hath; but God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit leſs by that that hee doth let out to his creatures;</hi> as thus, the Sea is full of water, yet if you take out but a little water, the Sea hath ſo much the leſs; therefore ſome of the Fathers would ſet out Eternity by this, that if a Sparrow ſhould but once in a thouſand years fetch one drop of water from the Sea in the bill of it, yet the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row would ſooner empty all the Sea, than the torments
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168883:21"/> of the damned ſhould bee at an end; ſo that if a drop bee taken out of the Sea it is the leſs: but God is ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ocean of beeing, of excellencies, of happineſs, that let him let out, and communicate never ſo much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet hee hath as much ſtill as ever hee had: God hath let out excellency, and good to all his creatures ever ſince the world began, all the good, the comfort, the happineſs, the ſweetneſs, the beauty and excellency of all creatures have been from God that infinite fountain, but now this fountain is as full as ever it was, and will bee as full to all eternity as ever it was: And here lyes the excellency of God beyond all creatures whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 In the next place, <hi>God alone is excellent, there is no compariſon to bee made between him, and any thing elſe;</hi> as thus, Take the creature in what wee think it comes neareſt to God, and the truth is, to ſpeak properly, it comes no nearer to God than thoſe things that wee think come leſs; as when wee ſay that God is a great God and fills all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if you ſhould ſuppoſe a body that ſhould fill all this world, it is no nearer to Gods immenſity than a moat that flyes in the Sun: or thus, Take never ſo many thouſand years, as wee ſpoke the laſt day, if an Accountant that ſhould write down figures all his life time, they would come wee think, to an infinite ſumme; yet all thoſe infinite millions of years come no nearer to Gods eternity, than one minute doth, and the reaſon that I give is unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe that there muſt needs bee alwayes an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance between what is finite, and what is infinite, and greater than an infinite diſtance there cannot bee; now take ſuch a body as ſhould fill the ſpace between heaven and earth, there remains ſtill an infinite diſtance between the Immenſity of God, and this body, and take ſo many numbers of years as poſſibly can be imagined by Men or Angels, yet there will remain an infinite diſtance between Gods eternity, and thoſe numbers of years; now greater than an infinite diſtance there cannot bee; therefore all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:168883:21"/> thoſe years do not come nearer to eternity than a minute, and all the greatneſs doth not come nearer to Immenſity than a moat in the Sun; God is beyond all compariſon whatſoever, and the underſtanding that God is an infinite beeing, will help us to underſtand all the reſt that I have named.</p>

There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes to convince us that there is a vanity in all things in the world, by the <hi>ſtrength of reaſon</hi> wee may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, <hi>and by experience:</hi> A man ſometimes that hath an eſtate, God doth but touch his body, and layes him upon his ſick-bed; ſuch a man ſaith, Oh what a poor thing is it to injoy all the world? had I all the world at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I could have no comfort in it, and therefore what a vanity is there in the creature: And another perhaps by arguments and reaſons, will tell you that every thing is vain, and there is no contentment, nor continuance in any thing in the world: When wee ſee men that are rich and great dye, and carry nothing with them, wee are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, Oh how vain the world is! theſe are ſome means to cauſe us to ſee the vanity of the creature: But what are all theſe to the ſight of God? The ſight of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168883:27"/> glory of God, it is infinitely more powerful to diſcover the vanity of all things in the world to us: That man, or woman, that hath had once a real ſight of this God in his infinite excellency, wil not much regard what becomes of him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning outward things in this world. <hi>Hee that ſees God to be great, will ſee all other things to bee ſmall.</hi> And indeed wee never ſee God to bee truly excellent, except wee ſee him alone to bee excellent. Thou thinkeſt thou knoweſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of God, I but ſtill the excellency of the creature is glorious in thy eyes: Certainly thou doſt not know God aright: If thou knoweſt God aright in his excellency, thou knoweſt him <hi>Alone</hi> to bee excellent, and therefore if thou kneweſt no other excellency but God, all other things would bee but vanity in thine eyes. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. ſaith the Apoſtle there concerning the glory of the Law, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory of the Goſpel, <hi>That that which was made glorious, now had no glory by reaſon of a greater glory that is come:</hi> So I may ſay in this caſe, the things of the world that were glorious in thine eyes before, yet now they are not glorious, but all darkned, becauſe there is a greater glory that now comes and ſhines in upon thee. If a man had lived in a dark Dungeon under the ground all the dayes of his life, and never had the glimpſe of any light what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, never ſince hee was born, if on a ſudden a candle ſhould bee brought to him, hee would admire at that glory; but now if this man ſhould afterwards bee brought into the world, and ſee the glory of the Sun, the glory of the candle would bee nothing to him: So the men of the world, becauſe they live as it were in darkneſs, they have ſome comforts in the creature, and they think them to bee glorious, for they know no better: But that ſoul that hath had a ſight of God, comes to ſee that all things in the world are but darkneſs to him. There is nothing can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage the heart of a man from the creature, ſo, as a ſight of God. You have a notable Scripture for that, how a ſight of God doth diſ-ingage the heart of a man from the creature, in <hi>Act.</hi> 7.2. And hee ſaid, <hi>Men, Brethren, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168883:28"/> Fathers, hearken, The God of glory appeared unto our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>when hee was in</hi> Meſopotamia <hi>before hee dwelt in</hi> Charran, <hi>and ſaid unto him, Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy kindred, and come into the Land which I ſhall ſhew thee:</hi> And ſo hee ſhews how <hi>Abraham</hi> was content to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all his friends and Country; Why? the God of glory appeared to him: it is ſaid upon this, when the Holy Ghoſt would ſhew what it was that brought <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his Country, that took off his heart from all his friends and Country, to go into a ſtrange Country, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>The God of glory appeared to our Father Abraham:</hi> Let a mans heart bee never ſo much glewed to any contentments that are here in the world, let but the God of glory appear to that man, and all things are vanity, then the heart quickly comes off from any thing. And indeed though there may bee many arguments that may make men and women to deny themſelves very much the uſe of creature-comforts, yet the heart is never throughly taken off till the God of glory appear to the ſoul. A notable example of ſelf-denial it that of <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> that might have had <hi>all the riches and glory of Egypt,</hi> might have been next to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, an heir, for ſo ſome write, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had no ſon, and that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter did adopt <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the end that hee might bee an heir to the Crown, and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> that had all riches, and the treaſures of <hi>Egypt</hi> at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet hee forſakes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l; but though hee forſook all for a while, yet you will ſay, did hee not repent him afterward? No, ſaith the Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. <hi>By faith hee forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King, for hee indured, as ſeeing him that is inviſible,</hi> that was the thing that did it, it made <hi>Moſes</hi> forſake all the riches of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and indure, to go on, and never repent him for making ſuch a choice: What was the great thing that did take <hi>Moſes</hi> off from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? It was the ſight of God, <hi>that God that was inviſible:</hi> My brethren, the ſight of God, it puts a mighty magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimicy upon a mans heart; there is nothing great to a great ſpirit, nor nothing can greaten the ſpirit of a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

And this again in the fourth place, may bee a Note of Trial, whether ever you have ſeen God alone to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; Hath it taken off your hearts from the creature? Hath it ingaged your hearts fully to God himſelf, that you can ſay, <hi>There is none in heaven,</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:168883:29"/> point of marvellous conſequence, the ſenſe of the diſtance between God and us: If God bee infinitely above the creature, then God expects that wee that profeſs any knowledge of him, that wee ſhould evermore have our thoughts upon Gods excellency, raiſed in a kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs above what wee think of the excellency of any creature; and our hearts then ſhould work after God in a kinde of infiniteneſs more than ever they did work after any creature, as there is an infinite diſproportion between the excellency of God, and the excellency that there is in any creature. I beſeech you obſerve what I am ſpeaking, for it is of marvellous uſe to help us to ſanctifie God in all our wayes; as there is an infinite diſtance between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of God, and of all creatures, ſo there ought to bee in a kinde, an infinite diſtance between what our hearts are in the working after God, and the working after the creature, otherwiſe wee lift not up Gods Name in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and glory. And indeed a gracious heart will make it ſo; and in this I conceive the very work of grace conſiſts, in that it is ſuch a principle in the ſoul of a man or woman that is converted, that though ſuch a one bee a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it hath a kinde of infiniteneſs in the working of it after God. You will ſay, Infinite, how can that bee? True, I confeſs properly it cannot bee infinite, but thus it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in its kinde, that is, ſuch a creature hath ſuch a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as it would fain, if it were poſſible, work infinitely after God: And</p>
                     <p>Further, This principle of grace doth cauſe this in the heart, that it will never limit its ſelf in any work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after God, and therefore hath a kinde of Infiniteneſſe; and here is the difference between one that hath true grace, and the moſt glorious hypocrite in the world; An hypocrite hee will ever bee bounding his working after God, and think thus much is enough, what need any more? If I do thus and thus, why I may do well, and go to heaven at laſt, and ſo doth bound himſelf: But now where there is the leaſt dram of true grace, though there bee many

                        </gap>et out my heart to the creature, but now I would fain, if I could, let out my heart infinitely after God: Why? For I ſee an infinite diſtance between the good there is in the creature, and the good there is in God; certainly where this is, there is grace, and this one note were enough to diſcern the truth of grace in the heart: If the ſight of God have wrought this, that whereas heretofore thy heart hath been let out after ſuch and ſuch creature-comforts, now thou doſt deſire, if it were poſſible, to let out thy heart infinitely after God; here is the work of grace, and in this thou goeſt beyond any hypocrite: Oh keep this conſtant in thy ſoul, this is the eſpecial ſanctifying of Gods Name in all our wayes; when wee ſee that God gives us leave to let out our hearts towards the creature in ſome meaſure, then there is a great deal of danger, that wee ſhould have our hearts ſtick in the creature, and that we ſhould not have that diſproportion in the letting out of our hearts to the creature, and to God, as ought to bee: And this is the ground of all Idolatry in the world, when men have ſeen ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the creature, they have been taken with it, and there have ſtuck, and have not been carried from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to God. And that is Heathens Idolatry, when they ſee an excellency in the Sun, they think that is God: So Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Idolatry may bee in this, If there bee any creature-comfort that thy heart cloſes withall, and there thou doſt ſtick, and thy heart is not carried to God, yea, is not carried to God in ſuch a diſproportion as there is between him and the creature; I ſay, ſo far as thou wanteſt that that thou art capable of in this kinde, ſo far thou art guilty of Idolatry. Oh that this one note might ſtick upon us, <hi>There is none like unto thee, O Lord:</hi> Canſt thou ſay this out of the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy ſoul, as in the preſence of God, Lord thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that though I have a vile heart that is let out after the creatures more than it ought to bee, yet Lord thou knoweſt that my heart is let out after nothing

                     <p>IF you read this verſe, and that that follows, you might think that you were rather reading an Evangeliſt, than a Prophet, one rather relating a Hiſtory of what was done, than a Prophecie of what was to bee done. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies clearly of Chriſt, as if hee had been come at that time, and yet it was between ſeven and eight hundred years before the coming of Chriſt that this Prophecie was, <hi>Unto us a childe is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall bee upon his ſhoulder; And his Name ſhall bee called Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.</hi> But it is the uſual way of Scripture to ſet before us things to bee done, as if they were already done, to note the certainty of what God reveals to bee done, and faith will make things that are not, to bee, as if they were really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And indeed, faith never hath a proper work ſo much as in this, in making things that are not preſent, to bee as if they were preſent, to make them real. It was a time of great diſtreſs and trouble to the Church God, when this Prophecie was, as will appear from the ſeventh Chapter
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168883:34"/> even unto this Propheſie. And frequently wee finde in Scripture in times of the greateſt diſtreſs of the Church, there were the cleareſt Propheſies of Chriſt, of the Meſſias to come.<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10. Dan. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Jacob</hi> Propheſies of <hi>Shiloh</hi> when hee was in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> of the Meſſias when hee was in Captivity, in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> here, <hi>To us a Childe is born, unto us a Son is given, whoſe Name is Wonderful Counſellor, the mighty God,</hi> when the people were in great diſtreſs. And there are four reaſons why the Lord would have the Propheſie of the Meſſias, at thoſe times eſpecially, when the Church was in a ſad, in a ſuffering condition.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe that the onely comfort of all the Saints of God then, was their expectation of the Meſſias to come, God would therefore propound Chriſt unto them as that that might lighten all their darkneſs, that might ſweeten all their ſorrows, and troubles; and indeed there was enough in this, in their expectation of the Saviour that was to come, this was that that made their hearts rejoyce in the middeſt of all their ſorrows; <hi>Abraham ſaw his day and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 8.56.</note> 
                        <hi>and was glad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Therefore had they the clear manifeſtation of Chriſt in the time of their outward troubles, to confirm their faith in this, that how-ever their enemies prevailed much againſt them, yet it was impoſſible that they ſhould root out the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the great Saviour of the world was to come out of them, therefore they were under Gods protection, and though they might ſuffer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, yet they could not ceaſe from being a Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Meſſias was to come out from them, and this was a great incouragement unto them to expect mercy from God, becauſe they were a people that the Lord would bring the great Saviour of the world out of.</p>
                     <p>And then thirdly, That by the propounding of ſo great a mercy as Jeſus Chriſt ſhould bee to the world, they might hereby have a help to their faith, that ſurely God would not deny them leſſer mercies: what great matter was it for them to expect from God deliverance from ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:168883:34"/> affliction, when as God makes known unto them, that love, and that infinite compaſſion, thoſe tender bowels of his, even to ſend his own Son into the world for them?</p>
                     <p>And then fourthly, It was to teach them this, that the way of deliverance from any outward affliction, it was to exerciſe their faith upon Chriſt the Meſſia that was to come, the Lord would teach his Church when it was in afflictions, not ſo much to bee looking at the preſent affliction that was upon them, and ſo to ſeek for outward help and means of deliverance, but would have them exerciſe their faith upon the Meſſia that was to come, though many hundred years after; and this exerciſe of faith was ſo pleaſing to God, as it was the onely means, or the chief means of deliverance from all outward afflictions: Nay, ſaith God, if ſo be that they will relye upon mee, and exerciſe their faith upon that great promiſe of mine, to ſend my Son into the world, as for their deliverance out of theſe outward troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it ſhall bee but a little matter for mee to do that for them; ordinarily when wee are exerciſed with outward afflictions, wee onely think of ſome natural helps and comforts, contrary to thoſe particular afflictions that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, whereas the way indeed for us to ſanctifie Gods Name, to do that that is acceptable to God when any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction befalls us, it is preſently to exerciſe our faith upon the great promiſe of God in Jeſus Chriſt, upon the great Covenant of Grace, that God hath made with us in him, upon that great mercy of God in ſending his Son into the world; my condition is very ſad, and I am grievouſly afflicted, I but ſurely that mercy that would ſend Jeſus Chriſt into the world, that mercy is enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver mee out of any affliction, or at leaſt to bleſs it to mee; therefore do not onely cry to God when you are ſick, or in trouble to deliver you from it, but labour to exerciſe faith upon the Covenant of Grace in Chriſt, upon that glorious mercy of God in his Son, that is the way that God would have us to ſanctifie his Name in. And that is the reaſon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168883:35"/> why in times of great affliction, there were ſuch clear Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of Jeſus Chriſt, as here in my Text, <hi>For unto us a childe is born, unto us a Son is given, and his Name ſhall bee called Wonderful, Counſeller, &amp;c.</hi> Now in this latter part of this verſe, wee have Chriſt ſet out unto us in five notable and famous Titles of his.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168883:36"/> when they ſaw and heard of ſuch ſtrange things at <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> birth, the Text ſaith, <hi>All they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,</hi> ſaying, <hi>What manner of Childe ſhall this bee?</hi> So when wee hear of theſe things that were done by way of preparation to the coming of Chriſt, for ſome two thouſand years together, and ſuch great things that were done upon his coming, ſurely it muſt needs bee ſome wonderful one. What manner of Childe is this that is given to us? wherefore then as wee read of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.9. when hee ſaw that wonderful ſight in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, the buſh burning and not conſumed, ſaith <hi>Moſes, I will go and ſee what yonder great ſight is;</hi> So wee may well ſay, when Chriſt is propounded thus Wonderful, and God himſelf gives him this Name, let us take off our thoughts from all other things, and turn aſide to ſee this great ſight, to ſee what this Wonder is. Therefore for the opening of this Wonder that is in Chriſt, to ſhew you how Chriſt is Wonderful, and how well hee may challenge this Name, and how proper this Title is to him, to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Wonderful,</hi> I ſhall open it in theſe ſeveral particulars.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Hee is wonderful in the manner of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Hee is wonderful in the wonderful work that hee came for into the world, the wonderful things that hee came to do.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Hee is wonderful in his Anointment, in his Offices.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Hee is wonderful in his admirable Indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                     <p>Eighthly, Hee is wonderful in that great glory of God the Father that appears in him.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, He is wonderful in the work of his Humiliation.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, Hee is wonderful in his Conqueſt.</p>

                     <p>Twelfthly, Wonderful in his Saints.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, hee is wonderful, and ſhall bee wonderful in the higheſt heavens, in the Church Triumphant: and in all theſe regards, wee ſhall ſee what a wonderful Saviour wee have, and what kinde of thoughts wee are to have of Jeſus Chriſt. As certainly for the want of the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and the low thoughts and apprehenſions wee have of him, the Name of God is little ſanctified among us; ſo for the want of the right underſtanding of Jeſus Chriſt, Oh how little is the Name of God ſanctified in the myſteries of the Goſpel? wee have the word (God) wee can ſay that God made us; and ſo the word Chriſt, and wee hope to bee ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, But oh, how far are wee either from apprehending God, ſuch an infinite and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God as hee hath already, though very darkly, been ſet out unto you? and ſo before wee have done, though it bee but in a Sermon or two, you will finde that your thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt have been too low and too mean: Oh that wee could by any means heighten your thoughts upon God and Chriſt, that you may know the Lord, and his Son whom hee hath ſent into the world.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Heads that I have propounded, they all might bee largely inſiſted on, but I think it beſt at firſt, to give you a ſhort view of things, and to preſent them together as briefly as I may. Wonderful in his Natures, for hee is God and man; our Saviour is God, and ſo hee is ſet forth unto us afterwards, the Mighty God, and is not this a wonderful thing, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde fallen from God, ſhould have no leſs Saviour than the Mighty God himſelf? If all the Angels in Heaven, and men in the world, had undertaken to have been the Saviours of one ſoul, they could never have done it, they could never have accompliſhed what they had undertaken; ſuch is the ſtate of man, as if ever hee bee ſaved, hee muſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168883:37"/> have a Saviour above the Angels, above all the ſtrength that there is in all the Angels in heaven, and creatures in all the world, hee is that God that you have heard of, whoſe <hi>Name is alone excellent, whoſe glory is above the heavens and earth,</hi> but that wee ſhould bee ſaved onely by God, may ſeem to ſome to bee no ſuch great wonder, who can ſave us but God? I but know, that here it is not God putting forth an Attribute to ſave us, but it is God undertaking this relation of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and God putting himſelf in another condition (as it were) and taking upon him our nature, therefore that is that indeed that makes the wonder, God-Man, <hi>Theanthropos,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> This is a wonderful myſtery; that there ſhould be ſuch a word, <hi>Theanthropos,</hi> God-Man, is the greateſt wonder that ever there was in the world, that there ſhould bee ſuch a thing as ſhould bee called God-Man, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and verily God and man together in one; I ſay, this is the greateſt wonder that ever was in the world, that the Divine and humane Nature ſhould bee joyned together, that wee ſhould have a Saviour that is as verily man as God, and as verily God as man, that thoſe two Natures, the Nature of God, and the nature of man ſhould come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one, that were ſo diſtant before one from another, this is a wonder beyond all ſenſe and reaſon, and wee had need have a Proſpective-glaſs of God to bee able to ſee indeed any thing into it; wee can eaſily beleeve (wee think) that Chriſt was God and man, every childe can do ſo; when you ask your children what Chriſt was, you teach them that hee was both God and man, I, but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you, when were your hearts taken with this as the geateſt wonder in the world, that there ſhould bee ever ſuch a thing as God and man in one, and that to be the Savior of mankinde? That man, that is miſerable, ſhould look up to God to ſave him, look up to the mercy of God, this were not ſo wonderful, but that miſerable man muſt bee ſaved by one that is God-Man, Man and God, this is that that except the Spirit of God that ſearches the deep things of God (as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168883:38"/> you had it before) reveal it unto a man, it were impoſſible for man ever to have ſuch a thought as this is; and indeed, the ſetting out of this ſo great a myſtery, is one great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Scriptures are Divine: for it is too high a thing to have entred into the thought of a creature; I ſay, too high a thing that ever a creature ſhould have ſuch a thought, that the ſaving of man muſt bee by Gods being man, it cannot bee imagined how ſuch a thought could have come into a creature, to bee verily man (I ſay) this argues the Scripture to bee from God, it is too great a myſtery for any creature ever to have imagined or thought of; it is that that is the ſtumbling-block to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and fooliſhneſs to the <hi>Gentiles; but the power and glory of God to thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved.</hi> If God ſhould have put this unto us, and ſaid, Well, I am inclined to do good to you, and willing to ſave you, but know, your eſtate is ſuch as you can never bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except there bee ſuch a Saviour, ſuch a Mediator for you, as muſt bee God and man both; why certainly both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men would have ſtood amazed at this, and have concluded, that the eſtate of Man-kinde is deſperate then, if ſo bee that the eſtate of man that is fallen from God, and hath ſinned againſt him, bee ſuch as there is no way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver one ſoul from eternal condemnation, and eternal wrath, but by ſuch a Saviour as muſt bee both God and man: I ſay, All Angels and Men, would have even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, then man muſt periſh for ever: but it is God, the Wonder-wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>king God that hath wrought thus for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, which hath ſent us ſuch a Saviour as is both God and Man; Surely then his Name may bee called <hi>Wonderful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſt is wonderful in his Perſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Secondly, Here is a greater wonder than that, God is God and man. God and man (you will ſay) that may bee, hee hath come in the ſimilitude of fleſh, and hath taken the ſhape of man, ſome kinde of union there may bee between the Divine and humane Nature; but conſider this ſecond Wonder, hee is not onely God, but a ſecond Perſon in Trinity: Conſider theſe two things in the Perſon of Chriſt,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168883:38"/> Firſt, He is to be looked at, not meerly as God, but as God the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, and this is a great wonder in Chriſtian Religion, for it was little known before. Wee read but little in the Old Teſtament about the Trinity, onely in Chriſt the Trinity comes to bee known; when wee are in ſtreights wee will cry to God that made the heavens and earth to bee a Saviour; but for us to know that wee muſt bee ſaved by God in the Second Perſon, that is the character and ingraven form of his Image, the Son of God, and yet ſo the Son of God as hee is Co-eternal with his Father, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with his Father, as the Scripture ſpeaks, and ſo God the Second Perſon in Trinity, as yet hee is of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that his Father is of, the ſame God, and yet the Son of God, the conſideration of the myſtery of the Trinity, that appears in Chriſt, is a great wonder above reaſon, that wee may adore it, but ſearch into it wee are not able.</p>
                     <p>And then the ſecond thing to bee conſidered in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this, That hee is not only God and man, but God and man hypoſtatically united, the union of the Natures, that theſe Natures ſhould bee united both in one Perſon, this is the great wonder in Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>There are two principal Wonders in Chriſtian Religion; I beſeech you conſider aright of them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is divers Perſons in one Nature.<note place="margin">2 Wonders in Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond is divers Natures in one Perſon.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the two Wonders in Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, divers Perſons in one Nature, and that is the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Trinity, for there you have but one Nature, the Divine Nature, but three Perſons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and that is a Wonder that the Heathens knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, and was little known till Chriſt came.</p>
                     <p>And the ſecond Wonder in Chriſtian Religion is, divers Natures in one Perſon, that is in Chriſt; Chriſt is God-man, but one Perſon united hypoſtatically; now to ſearch into this, that the ſame Perſon that is God, is man, and how the humane nature ſubſiſts in the Deity, and hath no ſubſiſtence at all in its ſelf, but in the Deity, how this is, onely the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:168883:39"/> Scripture reveals it to bee ſo, but how it is (I ſay) is too deep a ſea for any creature to wade into, wee muſt ſtand and admire it, and adore God in it, that hath revealed this as the object of our faith, but to bee able to ſearch how ſuch a thing can bee, that that union can bee in one perſon, this is that that is a wonder above all admiration: Indeed it is one of the moſt wonderful works that ever God did in the world, to unite two ſuch creatures that ſeemed to bee of ſuch diſtant Natures, as the body of man, and the Soul of man in one Perſon; to unite a peece of earth, and a peece of fleſh, to ſuch a glorious thing as a rational immortal ſoul is, the union of theſe two together in one perſon is the greateſt work, for the works of Nature, that ever God did in the world; <hi>David</hi> ſaw his body wonderfully and fearfully made; but certainly the union of the body and ſoul, the ſoul being of the ſame nature with the Angels, that it ſhould bee united with the body to make but one Perſon, this is a great wonder in the works of Nature: But to unite the ſecond Perſon in Trinity to the nature of man, not to the nature of Angels,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.</note> for ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Chriſt did not take upon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> for if Chriſt would have been united to another nature, one would have thought it ſhould have been to an Angelical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to refuſe that, and take mans nature, and unite it in one Perſon, that ſo it ſhould bee ſaid that that Perſon that is God, the ſame Perſon is man, Here is the great Wonder in Chriſtian Religion, the Perſonal union of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt; and indeed from hence many wonderful things will ariſe.</p>
                     <p>As from hence, that ſame Perſon that was the Creator of all the world was a creature; the ſame Perſon, I do not ſay the ſame Nature, this is the wonder in Scripture. And hee, the ſame Perſon that is the Lord of Man-kinde, yet is the Son of Man, the Son of Man, and yet the Lord of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Perſon that is Eternal, Immortal, yet hee dyed, ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>They crucified the Lord of glory:</hi> What, can God that is the Lord of glory, that made heaven and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:168883:39"/> earth, the Eternal God, <hi>whoſe Name alone is excellent,</hi> can hee bee crucified? yet that Perſon that was the Lord of glory, whoſe Name alone is glorious, that Perſon was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but ſuffered in his humane nature; whatſoever Chriſt did ſuffer in his humane nature, it may bee ſaid that that Perſon that was God did ſuffer, though not the Divine Nature, the Divine Nature could not ſuffer, but the ſame Perſon that was God as well as man hee did ſuffer; it is the Scripture phraſe clearly, and I might give you many Texts of Scripture to ſhew you that that perſon that was God, ſuffered, but that is enough, <hi>They crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. But you will ſay, to what great purpoſe is it for us to underſtand this, that Chriſt was God and man in one Perſon, is it not enough to underſtand that hee was God and man? what need wee look ſo much at the union of the two Natures? My brethren, Know that there is a great deal in this, in knowing the union of the two Natures. It is of marvellous uſe unto you for the helping of your faith, to know not onely that Chriſt had thoſe two Natures, but the union of thoſe two Natures.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay, <hi>How may it help our faith?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, becauſe hereby you may ſee that whatſoever Chriſt did, or ſuffered, though but in his humane nature, yet it was of infinite value and efficacy, and the infinite value and efficacy of what Chriſt did and ſuffered, doth ariſe from the union of the two Natures, becauſe it was that Perſon that was God, did ſuch things, and ſuffered ſuch things. I remember I my ſelf once knew a very godly man in the time of his ſickneſs was in a great Agony, under a very great temptation, and at Mid-night ſent a mile or two for a Miniſter, and hee comes to him, and this was his temptation: Fearing hee ſhould dye,<note place="margin">A temptation of the Devil to a godly man</note> and the Devil came with this temptation, Why, thy ſin doth deſerve an infinite puniſhment, thou haſt ſinned againſt an infinite God, and thou doſt deſerve eternal death; but Chriſt in whom you have truſted, hee being man, and ſuffering onely in his humane nature, hee could ſuffer onely that that was finite,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168883:40"/> and his death was but a few dayes, a day or two, how can he by ſuffering that that was but finite, by induring a little while pain upon the Croſs, and by being under death but a day or two, how can hee deliver you from an infinite ſuffering, and from eternal death? This was the temptation that lay upon him, and hee was in a moſt lamentable agony of ſpirit upon this temptation; but now in his calling to minde this, that though Chriſt in his humane Nature was but finite, and that that hee ſuffered could bee but finite, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his humane nature was united in one Perſon unto the Divine Nature, hence what the humane nature did ſuffer, though finite, came to bee of infinite value and worth, and though his death that hee was under, was but for a day or two, yet it was of merit ſufficient to ranſome from eternal death, becauſe the Perſon that was God as well as man, was under the power of death; and by recalling what hee had heard heretofore about Chriſt being God and man in one Perſon, hee came to bee eaſed, and the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began to vaniſh; and the truth is, there is no way that I know of, to ſatisfie ones heart and conſcience in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Chriſts merits, but in this, that it was the merit of him that was both God and man in one Perſon. It is true, thoſe that do not ſee a neceſſity of an infinite merit, they can eaſily ſatisfie themſelves, and ſay they beleeve in Chriſt Jeſus that dyed for them. I but how canſt thou tell that this death of Jeſus Chriſt is of infinite merit to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the infinite Juſtice of God that requires ſatisfaction for thy ſin? Why God hath ſo appointed it, and I hope in God it is ſo; but if thou canſt ſee the ground of this, that will bee a marvellous help to thy faith, that thou canſt look upon thy Mediator as God and man in one Perſon, and therefore thou canſt look upon whatſoever hee hath done or ſuffered as of infinite value, and ſo thou canſt preſent it with boldneſs unto God. The right underſtanding of Chriſt thus, will help us to honour Chriſt much, and will make him to bee a further object of our faith. Thus Chriſt is wonderful in his Perſon, in his Perſon as relating to God
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:168883:40"/> the Father, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity; So in his Perſon, that is, his humane and Divine Nature united into one Perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſt Wonderful in the manner of his Incarnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Well may hee have this Title of Wonderful, ſeeing hee is ſuch a one as hee is, thus opened unto you. But thirdly, Chriſt his Name is wonderful, hee is wonderful in the manner of his Incarnation. Chriſt hee is God and man; but how came Chriſt to take mans nature upon him? it was a wonderful and a ſtrange kinde of way that the ſecond Perſon in Trinity came to take our nature upon him, it was by being conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, by being born of a Virgin; Chriſt was man, and came from man, but not by man; the way of Chriſts generation it is wonderful, <hi>Oh who can declare it?</hi> Wee ordinarily can ſay,<note place="margin">

God faith that hee will do a great and marvellous thing;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſa</hi> 7.14.</note> 
                        <hi>For a Virgin ſhall conceive a Son,</hi> it is ſuch a thing as never was done before ſince the world began, nor never ſhall bee done again; the ordinary manner of the generation of man was here ſtopt, when Chriſt came to bee born, ſaith God, I will have a new way of generation, for indeed there was a great Lord to bee born into the world, a great Prince, and hee muſt bee born after another way different from the ordinary way of Mankinde, in a wonderful way, the Holy Ghoſt being the cauſe of the conception, and ſo brought forth by a Virgin: You will ſay, Why was this? Here indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the wonder that wee are to ſanctifie Gods Name in, not onely to know that it was after ſuch a way, and not as <hi>Adam</hi> was, hee was made man, but hee muſt bee made man in ſuch a marvellous way: You will ſay, why could
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168883:41"/> not Chriſt come into the world after the ordinary manner of generation? You will anſwer to your ſelves, God would have it ſo, but there is ſomething of Gods minde that he would have you know why hee would have it ſo: If Chriſt had been made man after the ordinary manner of generation, he could not have been made free from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, from original corruption, for the Law did lye upon <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; his Poſterity, againſt all that ſhould come from him in the ordinary way of generation, therefore if Chriſt now ſhould have come from him in the ordinary way, if hee had been of the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> then hee muſt have been under the Covenant that <hi>Adam</hi> was, for it was to all his poſterity, <hi>Adam</hi> was to ſtand as a publick perſon, unto his poſterity, and in him wee were to ſtand or fall. (Now whether there might have been any other way or no for Chriſt to have been freed from it, wee will not ſtand to diſpute.) But now Chriſt was freed from the Covenant, ſo as hee was not now under original guilt, under original corruption, becauſe hee was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, hee was conceived, not after the ordinary way of men, whereas you are to know, that all your children coming into the world after the ordinary way of generation, coming from man, by man, the firſt minute that their ſouls and bodies are together, that the childe is alive in the womb, it comes under the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, and comes to bee originally corrupted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently full of ſin and corruption; but it was not ſo in Chriſt, and this is the wonder of Chriſts Generation, that hee was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and born of a Virgin, and ſo free from all kinde of original ſin; had there been the leaſt ſin upon Chriſt, hee could never have been a Saviour for thee, nor any, therefore Chriſt muſt come into the world in ſuch a way as there muſt bee no ſin upon him at all, and this is the reaſon why hee was born of a Virgin, and not after the ordinary courſe of Mankinde, and therefore his Name may well bee called <hi>Wonderful,</hi> from the wonderful manner of his Incarnation.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the fourth place, Chriſt is wonderful in the wonderful Works that hee came about into the world; the work that Chriſt came into the world about, is the greateſt, and the moſt wonderful Work that ever was undertaken ſince the world began, or can poſſibly bee undertaken: Why what was the Work that Chriſt came into the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout?</p>
                     <p>It was firſt to ſtand between God, the angry God,<note place="margin">What the work was that Chriſt came into the world about.</note> God provoked with mans ſin, and ſinful man. It was to bee a Mediator between God and his creature, it was to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God and man together that had ſinned againſt him, and was turned enemy to him; the Work that Chriſt came to do, it was to make up all the wrongs that ſin had done, that ſin had brought to God, Chriſt came to make up the vaſt infinite breach that there was made between God and man, ſo to procure Reconciliation for man, as to make God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all the ſin that had been committed, here is the work that Chriſt undertook, hee undertook to pacifie the wrath of God his Father, in ſuch a way, as that it ſhould be let out upon him, and hee would bear what ever fruits of Gods wrath was due to the ſin of man, hee came (I ſay) into the world for to reconcile God and man, to make up all the breach, and to make reſtitution of all things; not onely to make up the breach that was made between God and man by mans ſin, but to make up the reſtitution of all things; whereas by mans ſin all the works of God in this world had almoſt been fruſtrated, and had mans ſin gone on, God had not had the glory that hee made the world for; now Chriſt hee comes into the world to make up all again, that his Father might have full glory from all his Works. Yea the great Work that hee came into the world about, was, that hee might bring this to paſs, that God his Father ſhould have further glory now from his work, than ever hee ſhould have had, if ſo bee there had never been
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168883:42"/> any breach made, here is the great work that Chriſt came into the world about, Chriſt beholding, that through mans ſin, all things were even brought to a confuſion, Mans ſin had plundered all the world (as it were) plundered the Works of God, and had brought all to darkneſs, and miſery, and confuſion, now Chriſt comes into the world to make all perfect again, and to raiſe up to God a Name of praiſe and glory, higher than ever hee ſhould have had if there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had been any ſin committed againſt him; now was not this a wonderful work that Chriſt came into the world about? wee ſpeak much of Chriſt, and that hee came into the world, but what came hee for? Oh learn to ſanctifie Gods Name in this, to look upon Chriſt whoſe Name is <hi>Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> in regard not onely of what hee was in himſelf, but of what hee came about, the great and wonderful work that hee came into the world for, and did accompliſh; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did wee apprehend Chriſt thus, and look upon Chriſt as having ſuch a Name as this is, <hi>Wonderful,</hi> and know that upon this ground hee is called <hi>Wonderful,</hi> it would teach us to adore him, to honour him, to magnifie him, and to have high thoughts of him, it would bee a mighty means to draw our hearts to beleeve in him, the very ſetting of Chriſt as hee is in himſelf before the ſoul as the full object of faith, hath a mighty power to draw faith out; as the ſetting of a temptation before a man hath a power to draw corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo the ſetting of Chriſt in his glory and excellency, in what hee is, and what hee came into the world for (I ſay) it hath a mighty power to draw forth faith, not onely to draw forth faith where faith was before, but it hath a power to cauſe faith in the ſoul; Chriſt is not onely an object for us to work upon when wee have a faculty, but ſuch an object as being ſet before the ſoul, hath a quickning power to cauſe life; therefore we cannot ſay, why ſhould Jeſus Chriſt bee preached to a company of people as are dead in ſins, I, Chriſt indeed is a glorious object, But they muſt have ſomewhat to work upon Chriſt.

Great in all theſe three Offices, never any man in the world had them all before, I ſay, never man in the world was Anointed to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168883:43"/> theſe three together, but onely Chriſt. Wee read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a King and Prieſt, ſo <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was; wee read in Scripture of a King, and a Prophet, and ſo <hi>David</hi> was; wee read in Scripture of a Prophet, and a Prieſt, ſo <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was: but of King, Prieſt, and Prophet together anointed by God, wee read of none but Jeſus Chriſt onely. Among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> they were wont out of their Philoſophers, their wiſe men, to chooſe their Prieſts, and out of their Prieſts to chooſe their Kings; and ſo whoſoever was a King to them, was eminent firſt in wiſdome, being a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, able to teach, and eminent in his Prieſtly office, and then eminent in his power, that hee might bee honoured by all people, as having thoſe threefold eminencies that was accounted the greateſt eminency in the world, for thoſe were the three great eminencies, the eminency of wiſdome to teach, and of Prieſthood, and of Kingly power: Now Jeſus Chriſt hee was wonderful in all theſe; now that is the thing that I aim at to ſhew in every particular of theſe Offices of Chriſt, how wonderful hee was, and then (though but briefly) I ſhall ſet the beauty and excellency of Chriſt in his three Offices before you, and that ſhall bee all that I intend to do at this time, and ſhall but bee very brief in them too: For I told you in the opening of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God, I did not intend to ſtand to open every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Attribute at large, but onely to ſet the Excellency of God before you briefly, ſo of Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>The Kingly Office of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for theſe Offices of Chriſt; his Kingly Office firſt; Chriſt is King, and wonderful in this Office of his, for you cannot underſtand Chriſt your Saviour aright, except you underſtand him, as before in his Natures, in his Perſonal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo in his Offices. Firſt, As King, I ſhall not need to ſhew Scripture for theſe, the Scripture is full. If you read the 45. <hi>Pſalm</hi> at your leaſure about the middle of it, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever, the Scepter of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:168883:44"/> is a right Scepter.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Chriſt there is ſaid to bee Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> Now Chriſt is a glorious King and wonderful in his Kingly power.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Hee is King over all, over all Kings, over all Powers, hee hath the higheſt Authority of all; Take that for the firſt thing. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 9 hee is ſaid to bee <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</hi> I remember <hi>Theodotius,</hi> and another Emperour, did uſe to call themſelves the Vaſſals of Chriſt, and ſo certainly all the Kings and Princes in the world, they are but the Vaſſals of this great King. Now hee is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in his Kingly power that hath all the Kings and Lords, and all Authority in the world under his feet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they all hold on him, and that will appear from the ſecond place.</p>

(I ſay) at firſt men they agree together to ſet up ſuch a man, or family, to have a Kingly Power, ſo that the Kingly power of the Family, and of every one that comes of that Family, it is by the people at firſt, none muſt plead it to bee by conqueſt, for then whoſoever can conquer again, hee muſt bee King, if another can conquer hee muſt have right too, if that bee the onely right, if that were the onely right that a King had over his people, conqueſt, then as hee had his right over the people by conqueſt, ſo if the people conquer him, then they have right. Certainly the beſt right of all the Kings of the earth this day, it muſt bee by the firſt compact with that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that is their right. I but our King that wee have to do withall, hee makes his Subjects, they make not him King, but this King makes all his Subjects; Indeed if Kings could give being to their Subjects, then their right were another kinde of right than now they have; but the truth is, Subjects do give being to their King; I but our King the Lord Chriſt hee is Wonderful, a Wonderful King in this, becauſe hee doth give being to all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168883:45"/> but hee alone makes Laws. It is true, the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> they made not the people joyn with them in all their Laws, becauſe God himſelf let Laws there for the government of the Commonwealth. But Jeſus Chriſt, I ſay, hee is the onely Law-giver unto his Church, and therefore there can bee no new Ordinances, nor no new Laws, nor no new Officers in the Church that can bee invented by man: It is true, in the Civil ſtate, there God leaves to humane prudence, and wee may invent Laws and humane Ordinances, and new Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſo as may bee good for the Church, one Kingdome one kinde of Law, and another, another; But now when wee come to ſpeak of Chriſts Kingly Power, eſpecially as it hath reference to the Church, there, as hee is King of Saints, there are no Ordinances, nor no Laws, nor no officers that can bee newly erected, but it muſt bee the ſame, and it muſt bee the ſame in all Churches in the World, the ſame Laws muſt rule all, and the ſame Ordinances, and the ſame Church-officers, there muſt bee no additions of any; Why? becauſe that in Spiritual government, there wee wait upon God for his preſence; wee wait upon the preſence of Chriſt to work ſpiritually upon the ſoul, and wee expect a ſpiritual efficacy from Jeſus Chriſt upon our ſouls, to draw us nearer to him, and to draw him near to us, that wee do in all Church Ordinances; and therefore onely Chriſt can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Laws for them.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay, <hi>(an there bee no Laws, no nothing added in the Church for way of decency and order, and ſuch kinde of things?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that I anſwer briefly thus, There are ſome things that do belong to thoſe ſpiritual Ordinances, things that are in the Church that may bee helpful to them in a natural way; as now if congregations meet they muſt meet in ſome place, they muſt have civil order in their meeting, there may bee ſome things civil and natural ſubſervient unto thoſe things that are ſpiritual; but that that is properly Eccleſiaſtical whereby I vvait upon Jeſus Chriſt to have my heart dravvn nearer to him, or to have him dravv nearer to mee therein,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168883:45"/> there muſt bee no addition of men in any Law whatſoever, but onely the things of Chriſt that are meerly ſpiritual; if there bee any natural help, or civil help, as wee that are men cannot bee exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ciſed in things that are ſpiritual, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome natural and civil helps, there certainly the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of man may come in; but this cannot come to ſet up any new Ordinances, or ſet up any new Officers in the Church, or make any new Laws that ſhall concern the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Worſhip of God, to work my heart in a ſpiritual way to God, or God unto mee; here lyes the evil of mans inventions, when there ſhall bee any inventions of man that ſhall come inſtead of a ſpiritual Ordinance, that ſhall bee ſet by mans Inſtitution, and have more put upon it than it hath in a natural and civil way to bee helpful, why then it comes to bee ſuperſtition, I ſay, when any thing is ſet by man in the worſhip of God, that ſhall have more in it than that that is natural or civil to help, then it comes to bee ſinful and wicked. When I think that by any thing of mans appointment, God ſhall come nearer to mee, or my heart ſhall bee drawn nearer to God, by vertue of any Inſtitution of man, here is the very proper nature of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; As for inſtance, Some thing that is natural or civil to help Gods worſhip, that man may appoint, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſpiritual to draw my heart nearer to God, or God nearer to mee. As thus, If the Church of God meet together for Ordinances, it muſt meet in ſome place, this is a natural help to have a convenient meeting-place, to have a place to keep them from the air, or rain, or wind, this is natural; but if it go one ſtep higher than natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the place, If I ſhall make this place by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of man to bee uſed as an Ordinance to draw mee nearer to God, or God nearer to mee, that is, to think that my prayers in that place are more acceptable than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that becauſe I perform ſervices in that place it ſhall bee more accepted, Here I ſay, man raiſes it higher than natural, and puts a Divine Inſtitution upon it, and ſo it comes to bee ſinful; and ſo now you may come to know
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168883:46"/> what the meaning is, when wee ſay, that Chriſt only can make Lawes for his Church, and Officers for his Church. Why? becauſe whatſoever is ſpiritual, it muſt bee only by the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt, this great King of his Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And then Sixthly, Chriſt is a wonderful King in this, that his Soveraignty is abſolute, which no Kings power is; though they have great power in the world, yet they have not an abſolute power to doe what they liſt; and certainly, no Subjects are bound ſo farre to the humours of men, that they ſhall doe what they liſt, there is no abſolute power that one man hath over another; bur the power that Jeſus Chriſt hath is abſolute, an abſolute Kingly power, his Will it is the Law; no mans will in the World is ſufficient to be a law, but the will of this King it is ſufficient.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 And then in the Seventh place, hee hath power to bind Conſcience, his Laws are ſuch as lay obligations and bonds upon the Conſciences of men; no Law that would be made by all the Angels in heaven could lay bonds upon conſcience, but the Lavv only of Jeſus Chriſt; all the Lavves that men can make, muſt receive their povver and authority eſpecially from the end of them, and therefore if they ſhould not conduce unto that end for vvhich God ſets up Magiſtracy over men, that is, for the good of the place, then the rule vvill hold, that if there be not ſcandal or contempt, there is no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a mans conſcience, meerly becauſe it is the will of man. But now the Lavves of Chriſt, vvhatſoever they are, they lay bonds upon conſciences, and if I doe offend them never ſo ſecretly, I ſtand as guilty before the great God; and that is the ſeventh thing.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 And then in the Eighth place, Chriſts Kingly power it reaches to mens hearts, (I muſt not as I goe along enter into the large opening of any thing that may be controverſal, but meerly preſent vvhat at large might be opened to you, about the Kingly povver of Chriſt) I ſay, Chriſts Kingly povver is vvonderful in this, in that it rules over the hearts of men as vvell as their conſciences; Chriſt by his povver is able to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168883:46"/> ſubue the vvills of men, and bring their hearts to obedience to him; all the power there is in the World cannot doe this: vvhy the Kings of the earth, if they vvere put all together, they could not ſubdue the heart of any one poor man in the world, the will of the pooreſt Creature in the world cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by all the powers of all the Potentates and Emperours upon the face of the earth; they may beat his body, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his body, or kill his body, but to ſubdue his heart, to make his ſoul to bee ſubject and obedient to them, that I ſay, all the powers of all the Potentates in the world, nay all the Angels in heaven cannot doe it, the will of a man or woman is ſuch, that all the Angels in heaven cannot bring it down, only God himſelf; you many times ſay, you will break the will of ſuch a one, that is, you will make them not to doe ſuch a thing, but you are never able to break their wills; Kings may prevail over their ſubjects, to make them to doe what they would have them doe, and their Eſtates and Liberties may come to be at their diſpoſe; but all this while it may be he hath never a one of their hearts, and that is but a very mean kind of Kingly power, only to rule over men by fear, and they not to love him. But now Chriſt in his Church, he hath never a ſubject that is truly under his Kingly power, but he rules his very will, and hath never a ſubject but loves him; where Chriſt doth rule Spiritually in the hearts of his people, though they were never ſo ſtubborn and rebellious before, yet when Chriſt comes and brings them under his power, hee brings their wills and their hearts to him, and that is the glory of the Kingly power of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 And then in the Ninth place, Chriſt is a wonderful King in this, that he hath the perfect knowledge of all his Subjects, and of their wants; alas, Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in great States, they know but very few Subject that they have; but now Jeſus Chriſt takes notice of every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that is in his Kingdom, and knowes all their thoughts, and all their vvayes, and all their vvants, all their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he knovves them all perfectly. Oh this is the glory of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168883:47"/> this King, and vvonderful is hee in his Kingly povver in this.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Hee is preſent vvith them all in all the Adminiſtration of Juſtice; the King hee cannot adminiſter Juſtice, but hee muſt uſe Inſtruments to doe it, and hee cannot bee preſent alvvayes; but Jeſus Chriſt hee is alvvayes preſent in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of vvhat ever is adminiſtred to any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he ſtands by and looks upon them all.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Chriſt is ſuch a King as he hath no need of any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all; hee may make uſe of them ſometimes, but he hath no need of any. Kings can doe but very little vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Inſtruments, vvhat can a King doe for the ruling of a Kingdom, but vvith ſuch and ſuch Inſtruments? But Jeſus Chriſt is vvonderful in his Kingly povver, in that hee hath no need of any Inſtruments for the adminiſtration of any Juſtice, but he can doe it all immediately himſelf, if he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 Chriſt is glorious in his Kingly power, in this, that he doth over-rule all the plots and counſels of all the enemies of his Subjects, for the furtherance of the glory of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the good of his Subjects; now my brethren, look upon theſe things as real, and certainly by faith they are made real to the hearts of the Saints, and they doe rejoyce in this; if we had ſuch kind of Governours, that had power over all the plots and deſigns of the enemies, what a happy condition would we think our ſelves to be in? Now this is in our King the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath power over all the plots and endeavours of all adverſaries, to work them all for the good of his Church.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 Further, the Lord Chriſt is wonderful for his Kingly power in regard of his righteouſneſſe, <hi>Thy ſcepter is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſcepter,</hi> he is King of righteouſneſſe, and ſo King of peace, as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was. It is a happy thing when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live under righteous Governours, that they ſhall be ſure never to have any oppreſſion, any wrong at all done by them, but they ſhall enjoy all in a righteous and juſt way; Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch a King, thou ſhalt have nothing but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168883:47"/> righteous dealings from him. I, but there is ſomething more in this, he is not only righteous, becauſe he makes righteous Lawes, and hath righteous Adminiſtrations, but this is a King that brings everlaſting righteouſneſſe to his people, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he himſelf is the righteouſneſſe of his people; it is hee that doth cloath his people with righteouſneſſe. Indeed it is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> that hee cloathed the people with Scarlet; By a good Governour people may come to be cloathed with fine raiment, and enjoy glorious proſperity, and the like: But this is that King that cloathes his people with everlaſting righteouſneſſe; to make them all to ſtand righteous before his Father, here is the glory of this King. And then hee brings peace, he brings peace by righteouſneſſe, hee doth not bring peace to them by the ſword, but by his righteous Adminiſtrations; ſo he comes and brings peace, brings peace to the conſcience, to the ſoul, which no Kings can doe. What can Kings doe? they may treat about peace, and if they be righteous they may be the cauſe of abundance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace; I, but they cannot bring peace of ſoul; Chriſt is the King of Righteouſneſſe, and the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> ſo <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> ſignifies, hee was King of Righteouſneſs, and King of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, King of peace; this is the glory of this our King.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 And further, other Kings are born to bee Kings, but Chriſt dyed that hee might bee a King; it is true, hee was a King when hee was born, and hee was born as others are to be a King, but eſpecially Chriſt had his power upon his death, <hi>it behooved him to ſuffer, and ſo to enter into his glory;</hi> ſo to enter into his glory, that is, upon his ſufferings, it behooved him; and ſo the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi> that they had crucified Chriſt, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their crucifying of him, <hi>Peter</hi> there ſtands up and tells them in the ſix and thirtieth verſe, that <hi>God had made that ſame Jeſus whom they had crucified, both Lord and Chriſt;</hi> by his death he came unto his glory. Others come to glory by their Lives, but Chriſt comes to his glory by his Death, and was raiſed to ſit upon the Throne of Majeſty and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168883:48"/> glory upon his death, and in that hee is wonderful in his Kingly power.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 Further, Chriſt is King from everlaſting to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, for ever; <hi>Thy throne O Lord endures for ever and ever:</hi> other Kings are but of yeſterday, and they are dead and gone; but it is not ſo with our King, <hi>the Lord is King for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16 Further, he is wonderful in this, he ſits upon his Fathers Throne now at this time. You have ſuch a place in the third of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> verſ. 21. where Chriſt promiſes to thoſe that over-come, that they ſhall ſit upon his throne, even as he over-came, and is ſet down with his Father in his throne. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of all things in the World now, I ſay, it is given to Chriſt joyntly with his Father, Jeſus Chriſt God-Man, ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of his Father, not only the ſecond Perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but Chriſt God-Man ſits upon the Throne of his Father, &amp; together with his Father doth order and govern all things; here is a height of glory that no creature elſe can bee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; the Humane Nature of Chriſt being joyned in one Perſon with the Divine, ſo it comes to have of the glory of this Kingly power upon it, that it may bee ſaid, That Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is Man, doth now at this time ſit upon the Throne of his Father, and together with his Father doth adminiſter his power; ſo that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a ſubjection of Chriſt that ſhall be afterwards unto the Father more than is now,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.25, 26, 27, 28.</note> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. it is a text certainly that hath a great myſtery in it, and is very hard to underſtand, <hi>For hee muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet; the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death, for he hath put all things under his feet; but when he ſaith, all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted which did put all things under him; And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi> When all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then the Son himſelf ſhall bee ſubject. It ſeems there is not that ſubjection now as ſhall be hereafter; Chriſt now ſits upon the Throne of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and rules together with his Father, but there is a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168883:48"/> time that Chriſt ſhall give up the Kingdome that now hee hath, and hee himſelf ſhall bee ſubject, that is, hee, when hee hath ſubdued all the enemies of the Church, hee ſhall in a viſible and a more glorious way rule over his own Saints, and that eternally, and then hee to together with his Saints, he as the head of his Saints, ſhall in another way bee ſubject unto God than now hee is for the preſent, there ſhall bee another adminiſtration of things than now there is; now Chriſt ſits upon the Throne oF his Father, here Chriſt makes his Throne &amp; his Fathers Throne diſtinct, ſo that there is yet to come another kinde of Throne that Chriſt hath, beſides the Throne that now hee ſits upon; but this, I ſay, is a great myſtery, onely the Scripture holds forth ſuch a thing as this, that hereafter Chriſt ſhall have another Throne than that hee hath now.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 Yea Wonderful in this, that hee will not onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all enemies in the concluſion, but hee will put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power. It is a very notable Text often read, but little obſerved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Then cometh the end, when hee ſhall have delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father, when he ſhall have put down all Rule, and all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power.</hi> Though as our condition is for the preſent, we have a great deal of need of humane Rule and Authority, yet that is certain, that there hath not been any ſuch enmity unto the Kingdome of Chriſt, as the Rulers, and Kings, and Princes of the earth, for the greater part, I ſay, Chriſt hath had no men that have more kept-under his Kingdome than the Rulers &amp; great ones, and Princes of the earth, therefore it ſeems his Kingdome cannot bee full till hee hath put down all Rule and Power, and hee himſelf to reign wholly without any ſuch help of man as now. But now in regard of our neceſſity, it is true, If all Rule and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould bee put down while wee are in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as wee are for the preſent, certainly wee ſhould bee all in a confuſion, therefore though Chriſt ſees that ſo many of the Rulers and great ones of the world have been, and are enemies to his Kingdome, yet to keep things in a civil
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168883:49"/> order, Chriſt would have Rule and Authority for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; But there is a time coming, when his people ſhall bee made ſo ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="18">18 And then the laſt of all, Chriſt is ſuch a King, as hee doth in a ſpiritual ſenſe make all his Subjects Kings, hee hath a Crown of glory for every Subject, for every one of thoſe that are his Subjects, in that near relation, as hee is King of Saints, I ſay, hee will put Crowns of glory upon them all; you have it in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10. <hi>And haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and wee ſhall Reign on the earth,</hi> not onely in heaven, but on the earth.

                     <p>This is our King, <hi>Rejoyce therefore oh Daughter of Zion, for thy King cometh.</hi> Oh did wee but apprehend theſe things by faith, that wee have to do with Chriſt as ſuch a King, certainly our hearts could not bee troubled whatſoever ſtirs there are in the world, whatſoever Kings and Princes do in the world; yet when wee look up to this King, and by faith make all this real to our ſouls, Oh what matter of infinite joy is it! I beſeech you do not think that theſe are notions that I ſpeak unto you, thoſe that exerciſe their faith aright upon Chriſt, they exerciſe their faith upon him as ſuch a King.</p>
                     <p>You ſay you do beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>In Chriſt, Why what do you mean by Jeſus Chriſt? Why you will ſay, hee was the Son of God. But what is further? Chriſt that is (Anointed) Anointed to what, to King, Prieſt, and Prophet; King, what kinde of King?

                        </gap> things that ſeems to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Church, for the good of his Church, otherwiſe it could not continue in the world: <hi>Oh let the earth rejoyce, becauſe the Lord doth Reign;</hi> And again, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.1. mark there what uſe is made of Chriſts Kingly power. <hi>The Lord Reigneth, let the people tremble;</hi> Oh the Lord Reigneth, let the people tremble; certainly all wicked and ungodly men that are Rebels againſt this King, they have cauſe to tremble, ſuch men as ſay of Chriſt, <hi>Wee will not have this man to reign over us,</hi> they have cauſe to tremble, for the Lord Chriſt will overcome them; certainly his Garments ſhall bee dyed in blood, and what will become of them when hee ſhall come to take his Kingdome to himſelf? Moreover; <hi>Thoſe mine enemies that would not have mee to Reign over them, come and bring them, and ſlay them before my face.</hi> All wicked and ungodly men in their ſins, they do as if they ſhould ſay thus, wee will not have this man to Reign over us; thou who doeſt caſt off Jeſus Chriſt as a King, certainly thou canſt not expect good from him as a Saviour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſts Prieſtly Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the ſecond thing, and that is the Prieſtly Office
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168883:50"/> of Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt is wonderful in that, hee is a great High Prieſt. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. Chriſt is there called a <hi>Great High Prieſt, Seeing then that wee have a Great High Prieſt that is paſſed into the heavens;</hi> And ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>For ſuch an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher than the Heavens.</hi> A great High Prieſt, a High Prieſt made higher than the Heavens, this is the High Prieſt that we have which we are to exerciſe our faith upon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Hee hath a Royal Prieſt-hood, for it is joyned with Kingly Power, and therefore <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was his type. Hee was not after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but hee was after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> becauſe it is a Royal Prieſt-hood, and ſo the Saints are called a Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; And <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> is ſaid to bee without Father or Mother: the meaning is, Hee was not ſo as hee was a man, for hee had Father and Mother, beginning and end, but in his typical relation hee was ſo, they were concealed, to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie, that Chriſt, as hee was man, hee had no Father, and as hee was God, hee had no Mother, and hee had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in his Prieſtly office, it was from everlaſting, and it ſhall indure to everlaſting. <hi>So hee is a Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>and not after the Order of</hi> Aaron.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And in the next place, All the Prieſts in the Law did typifie Chriſt, and all did ceaſe in him; certainly hee muſt needs bee a great High Prieſt that was typified by them, and in whom all ceaſed and vaniſhed: As when the Sun ariſes, the light of the ſtars doth no more appear; there was no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſthood when Jeſus came and took that Office to himſelf in his humane Nature in this world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But further, Chriſt is wonderful in his Prieſt-hood in this, that hee had no need to offer for himſelf, as others had; for hee was blameleſs, and without ſin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Yea, and conſider what Chriſt offered, and there you ſhall ſee him wonderful; the Offering that Chriſt offered, it was the blood of God, I ſay, it was that that wee may call ſafely according to Scripture language, the blood of God; and that will not ſeem to bee a hard expreſſion, if
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168883:51"/> wee underſtand what the perſonal union of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, in <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. faith the Apoſtle to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Take heed therefore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God which hee hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi> Theſe kinde of phraſes wee have that come from the Perſonal union of the two Natures; ſo that the blood that Chriſt did ſhed, and offer unto God as a Sacrifice for the ſin of man, it is that that the Scripture calls the blood of God. Now the blood that other Prieſts did offer, was the blood of Goats, and Bulls, and Lambs, and Kids, but now what a wonderful Prieſt have wee, that comes to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Father for us, and comes to offer blood, that is the blood of God. Hee is wonderful in his Prieſtly Office in regard of his Offering.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Further from this follows, that Chriſt offered a Sacrifice unto God that was ſufficient to ſatisfie God for all the wrong that ever was done him by mans ſin; they offered poor things unto God, you know, in the time of the Law, things that were worthleſs: But now the Sacrifice that Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto the Father, when hee, that High Prieſt, came to offer, it was a Sacrifice that did ſatisfie Gods infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, did make up all the wrong that all the ſins of the Elect had ever done to God, it was that that infinite Juſtice ſaid it was well-pleaſed withall. It was worth all that Chriſt did render it up to his Father for, not onely a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was a ſweet ſavour, becauſe God would bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept of it, but a Sacrifice that had in its ſelf ſuch a ſavour that could not but bee ſweet in the noſtrils of God the Father, for it did fully ſatisfie the Juſtice of God the Father for the ſins of mankinde; here is a wonderful High Prieſt now, that hee ſhould come and offer ſuch a Sacrifice that ſhould bee of ſuch infinite merit and worth as it was.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Yea, and hee was wonderful, becauſe that hee did offer himſelf, not onely his blood, but himſelf, ſoul and body, hee made himſelf a Sacrifice, none of the Prieſts
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:168883:51"/> did ſo in the time of the Law; was there ever heard of ſuch a Prieſt that came to offer ſacrifice, that did offer himſelf for ſuch as hee would make attonement for? Jeſus Chriſt hee was anointed by God the Father as a Prieſt of his Church to offer ſacrifice, now hee muſt have ſo nothing to offer, and Chriſt ſaw that whatſoever hee could offer, if ſo bee that hee had offered that that had been the worth of Heaven and Earth, whatſoever it had been, it could never have been an Attonement for thoſe ſouls which hee did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for, therefore Chriſt offers himſelf; as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God can bee a ſatisfying portion to an immortal ſoul, ſo no ſacrifice but Chriſt himſelf could bee a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to pacifie Gods wrath for the ſins of mankinde, if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, Father, Thou haſt made mee Lord over all the world, and I will give it all for a Ranſome for the ſoul of this poor ſinner, God would have ſaid, It will not do it, but it muſt bee thy ſelf; I, and Chriſt yeelds to it, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared mee:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10</note> 
                        <hi>And bee made his ſoul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin.</hi> And a body haſt thou prepared for mee, both body and ſoul of Chriſt was offered to God the Father for a ſacrifice, that hee might ſmell a ſweet ſavour of reſt, even concerning us who are wicked and wretched ſinners. Either Chriſt muſt offer himſelf ſoul and body to bee a Sacrifice for thy ſin, or elſe thy ſoul and body muſt have been offered as a ſacrifice to Gods Juſtice, and then it muſt eternall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> have been under the ſtroke of Gods Juſtice; but to that end to free that ſoul and body of thine, if thou beeſt a beleever, to free thee from the eternal Juſtice of God, therefore Chriſt did offer his ſoul and body as a ſacrifice to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 And yet further, Chriſt was wonderful in his Prieſtly Office, for hee was not onely the Sacrifice, but the Altar. It would bee wonderful to hear of a Prieſt that ſhould offer himſelf, but the Prieſt to bee the Sacrifice, and the Altar too that ſhould ſanctifie the Sacrifice, it is a greater wonder: and becauſe this expreſſion ſeems to bee very hard, I take this out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168883:52"/> bloud of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God;</hi> he offers his body and ſoul as it were upon his Divine Nature, that as the Altar did ſanctifie the Offering, ſo the Divine Nature of Chriſt did ſanctifie the offering of his Humane Nature, ſo that he indeed became both the Altar, and the Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 And then further, Chriſt is wonderful in his Prieſtly Office, and that is in this, That he offered but one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and at one time; now the Prieſts in former time, they offered many Sacrifices, and they offered often; but now if you would read of Chriſts Prieſtly Office, read eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth Chapters of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and there you ſhall have as much almoſt as in all the Scripture beſides, of the Prieſtly Office of Jeſus Chriſt; The Prieſts in the Law they offered often, but Chriſt offered but once, and having but once offered hee ſits down in glory, upon his offering of himſelf but once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father it was available for ever, for ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us in divers places of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and hee was able to ſave to the uttermoſt, upon his once offering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And then further, Chriſt is wonderful in his Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in this, which is as much as in any thing, and that is, that he doth now exerciſe it in heaven at the right hand of the Father by his interceſſion, for ſo the Scripture ſaith in the eighth of the <hi>Hebrews, That we have ſuch an high Prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty in the heavens,</hi> and there he is making interceſſion. As the Prieſt (you know) in the time of the Law did exerciſe his Prieſtly Office, not only by offering Sacrifice, but by going into the Holy of Holies, and there had the names of the Tribes ingraven upon his breſt, and ſo preſented them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and made interceſſion for all the Tribes. Alſo Chriſt he is our wonderful High Prieſt, for he having offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf a Sacrifice to the Juſtice of his Father, hee is gone to Heaven, and hath the names of all Beleevers upon his breſt, upon his heart, and there preſents them all before
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168883:52"/> his Father, and is their Advocate, makes interceſſion for them, hee is alwayes holding before the Father all his Sufferings, as it were pleading before God the Father for them. Why thou art a poor Creature here, and art, it may be, fallen down in thy cloſet pleading with God for mercy, and thou art diſcouraged for the ſtraitneſſe of thy heart, and the like, but now learn how to make uſe of thy faith, look upon Jeſus Chriſt, hee is the object of thy faith; I, but you muſt beleeve in Chriſt as the High Prieſt that is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into Heaven, and now is at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther making interceſſion for thy ſoul. It may bee thou art diſcouraged becauſe thy prayers are poor and weak; I but thy faith muſt bee exerciſed upon that God-man, who is pleading with God the Father for thee, and that by his own merits, that are worth more than ten thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds, and except you doe exerciſe your faith upon Chriſt as a Prieſt thus, you doe not exerciſe your faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; Oh what ſtrangers are moſt people in the world to the exerciſing of faith! I appeal to you, when did you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe your faith upon Chriſt as ſuch an High Prieſt? you would ſee him to be a wonderful Saviour indeed, if by the eye of faith you did behold him to be thus.</p>
                     <p>Thus he is wonderful in his Prieſtly Office; oh what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things are theſe, if they were made real to us by faith! How wonderful would be the comfort and joy of the Saints of God in the exerciſing of their faith, upon this that I doe but now name unto you, whereby as wee goe along you may ſee how farre ſhort you have come from exerciſing your faith upon Chriſt as ſuch a Saviour, as the Scripture doth preſent him to you.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Again, his Prieſtly Office endures for ever, hee lives for ever to make interceſſion; the Prieſts in the Law they dyed, but Chriſt he is a Prieſt for ever, and hee makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion himſelf, he hath no Deputy, nor no Succeſſors as others had, but he himſelf makes interceſſion for ever for his people, and his Prieſt-hood is confirmed by an Oath,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.41</note>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168883:53"/> of Chriſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> to the end that we might bee the more ſure of ſuch a wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to Mankind, that is the reaſon that he added an Oath to the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt, becauſe that aymed at higher things than the Prieſt-hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> did, that was but an external Prieſt-hood, but this ayming at ſuch high things, yea that Sacrifice that muſt bee tendered up to God for a full attonement for the ſin of Mankind, therefore God confirmed this by an Oath; for beleevers when they hear ſuch things (thoſe that are weak) I but Lord (think they) are theſe things ſo? is it poſſible that God ſhould have ſuch thoughts of Mankind, to work ſo wonderful for mans Salvation! therefore ſaith God, I have confirmed this by an oath.</p>
                     <p>And then this Prieſt-hood of Chriſt is a Prieſt-hood of a better covenant, the other was but after a carnal Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; and in compariſon of this it was but an external covenant, for there was certainly a covenant of Works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of Grace, that God did renew with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even when he gave the Law, the Ceremonial Law did not only typifie the Covenant of Grace that ſhould bee revealed hereafter more fully, but it was annexed to the Covenant of Works, as it appears plainly in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but yet ſtill I ſay they had a Covenant of Grace that was coucht darkly in the Ceremonial Law, therefore Chriſt is ſaid to be a Mediator of a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he comes to deal between God and Man in a better Covenant than was before.</p>
                     <p>And then further, the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt it comes to have more efficacy than that of <hi>Aaron</hi> had, for it prevails to the purging of conſcience, which that could not doe.</p>
                     <p>And it brings the Saints into the Holy of Holies, and that with boldneſſe, and for that you have a moſt excellent Scripture of the Saints being brought into the Holy of Holies by the Prieſt-hood of Chriſt, in the tenth to the <hi>Hebrews, Having therefore boldneſſe to enter into the holieſt by the bloud of Jeſus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10.19.</note> by the Sacrifice that this our Prieſt hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:168883:53"/> to the Father, we come to enter into the Holieſt of all, and that with boldneſſe.</p>
                     <p>It was not ſo in the time of the Law; no, but after the High Prieſt had offered Sacrifice, hee alone goes into the Holy of Holies; but now mark, here not only Chriſt our High Prieſt, but we, may come with boldneſſe, which none of the people could doe in the Law, that is thus, there is ſuch an efficacy in the Sacrifice of our High Prieſt, as that every beleever may come, though hee hath never ſo many ſins of his own, he may come with boldneſſe into the Holy of Holies, into the moſt immediate preſence of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through the ſacrifice of this our Prieſt, that hath made ſuch a way by his Bloud for us, to come and enter into the Holy of Holies; the People in the time of the Law were to ſtand at a diſtance, for this Sacrifice was not actually offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but ſince Chriſts coming, and his actual offering up his Sacrifice, now the Saints of God may come with boldneſſe into the holy, immediate, and glorious preſence of God that can bee; let God appear never ſo gloriouſly, yet the Saints have liberty and boldneſſe to come into the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence of God; and therefore Chriſt is wonderful in this Prieſtly Office of his. Two or three things more ſhould have been ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>That Chriſt hath made us Prieſts unto God, wee have the glory of his Prieſt-hood upon our ſelves, if wee belong unto him; Prieſts, that wee may offer up Sacrifice to God now acceptable; were it not through the vertue of this Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, we could not doe it: But it is by the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office of Chriſt that all Beleevers are now made Prieſts unto God, ſo as they may offer Sacrifice to God acceptable; it may be thou goeſt to God in Prayer, and offereſt up a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, and thinkeſt God will be well pleaſed with it, I pray now upon what terms doſt thou offer them up? Thy Prayers ſhould bee Sacrifices, but in the time of the Lavv none muſt offer a Sacrifice but a Prieſt; Haſt thou an intereſt in the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, and doeſt thou goe unto Jeſus Chriſt by faith, and give up thy Sacrifice into his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:168883:54"/> hands, and deſire that hee vvould preſent it to the Father? certainly except thou doſt ſo, all thy Sacrifices are caſt out as dung and filth in thy face, and are an abomination unto God. As in the time of the Law we know, let a man offer never ſo good a Bullock, or Sheep, though they were worth never ſo much, yet if hee did not offer them by the Prieſt, we know they were abomination unto God: ſo our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are as our Sacrifices, and they muſt be offered up unto God by this our High Prieſt; and in this Jeſus Chriſt is wonderful in his Prieſtly Office, for by vertue of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his that he offered to the Father, all the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all the elect ones are tendered up to the Father, and ſo come to be accepted; And then doe wee exerciſe our faith upon Chriſt aright, when we can look upon our High Prieſt, and tender up our Sacrifices by faith unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through him.

                        <hi>The Prophetical Office of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt is wonderful in his Prophetical Office; I will but name one or two particulars about that, which is exceeding comfortable.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a wonderful Prophet he muſt needs be, for hee is one that knowes all the minde of God the Father perfectly, which certainly all the Creatures in the world doe not; take all the Angels in Heaven, and Men in the World, and they know not all that is in the heart of God the Father. Now Chriſt he knows all that is in the very heart of the Father, and whatſoever the Father doth, Jeſus Chriſt knows it; in the fifth of <hi>Joh.</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>For the Father loveth the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:168883:54"/> Son, and ſheweth him all things that himſelf doth;</hi> there is nothing that God the Father doth, but he ſhews it all to Jeſus Chriſt; and in the firſt of <hi>John,</hi> verſ. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, but the only begotten Son which is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father.</hi> This is a wonderful Teacher indeed, a glorious Prophet, wee may well call him Wonderful in regard of his teaching. He is called <hi>(the)</hi> Prophet, and <hi>(that)</hi> Prophet in Scripture, becauſe he is one that came from the boſome of the Father, and lives in the boſome of the Father, and whatſoever the Father hath done or will doe, he ſhewes it unto him, and therefore he knowes all the mind of his Father, and knowes all things that doth any way concern his Church, or whatſoever ſhall befall his Church, it is hee that knowes it, and is able to make it known as he pleaſes; and hee is anoynted by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the teacher of all thoſe that are elect ones, and that doe belong to Chriſt, he hath taken the charge of every one of them, to teach and inſtruct them in all the mind of his Father; now next unto the Sacrifice of Chriſt, there is no one thing in Scripture of greater uſe than this to the Servants of God; beleevers many times goe away, and ſay, oh I have heard of great and wonderful things, but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand them; oh doe not goe away diſcouraged, but remember the laſt thing that is ſaid in the Sermon, that Chriſt is wonderful in his Prophetical Office, and hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the charge of thy ſoul to inſtruct it in all the mind of his Father, and ſo farre as is neceſſary for thy Salvation thou ſhalt be inſtructed, or Chriſt muſt be unfaithful in his Office; now that cannot be, but except thou be inſtructed this muſt be ſo, for Chriſt hath the charge of thee. And this is made in Scripture as a fruit of his being ſlain, in the fifth of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>And I beheld, and loe in the midſt of the Throne, and of the fear Beaſts, and in the widſt of the Elders, ſtood a Lamb as it had been ſlain, and hee came and opened the ſeals,</hi> opened the Prophecies, and ſo fore-told what ſhould befall the Church to the end of the World; it was a Lamb ſlain that did it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168883:55"/> fruit of the death of Chriſt, that thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Saints come to bee opened and made known unto them, and Chriſt cannot plead to his Father, and ſay, that thou gaveſt me the charge of ſuch and ſuch, but they were dull and could not learn, and therefore that is the ſecond thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That the dulneſſe cannot hinder, whether they have ſtrong parts, or weak parts, it is all one to the teaching of Jeſus Chriſt, it may be a hinderance to a Miniſters teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but if they come under the teaching of Jeſus Chriſt, it is all one, whether ſtrong parted, or weak parted, it makes no difference at all; and there is one Scripture that doth declare the faithfulneſſe of Chriſt in his Office, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite treaſury of comfort it is to the Saints; in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>John,</hi> verſ. 15. there is an expreſſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office of Chriſt, ſaith Chriſt there, <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſervants, for the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt knows the counſels of his Father perfectly, and all his will and mind; now ſaith he, all things that I have known of the Father, that is, that concerns you to know, there is nothing that I have known of my father from eternity, that any way concerns you to know, but I have revealed it to you; Chriſt he is the Prophet of his Church, to reveal to thy ſoul, if thou beeſt a beleever, whatſoever he knowes of his Father, all thoſe treaſures of wiſdome, and counſels of his Father concerning thy eternal eſtate, Chriſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by his Father to make theſe things known unto thee, firſt or laſt thou muſt come to know what thou art capable to know. Oh how wonderful is Chriſt in this Prophetical Office of his, to undertake to teach all the elect from the beginning of the world to the end; this indeed is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many poor weak people doe underſtand more of Chriſt than many learned men doe; you will ſay, Wee never can beleeve it, that ſuch poor ignorant people ſhould underſtand things of religion better than Learned men, and great Rabbies.</p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:168883:55"/>
                     <p>Thou ſpeakeſt ignorantly, and carnally, thou doſt not underſtand what the Prophetical Office of Jeſus Chriſt doth mean, for God the Father hath anoynted Jeſus Chriſt to come to inſtruct his elect ones in all the myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and whatſoever he hath heard from the Father hee tells them. When God the Father ſent Chriſt into the World, he ſaith, <hi>Goe your way;</hi> and this is the charge that I lay upon you, that whatſoever you have heard of me from all eternity, firſt or laſt, reveal it to thoſe ſouls; it is a wonderful benefit that the Saints have by this Prophetical Office of Chriſt; and this is ſpoken to his Diſciples, not as eminent only, but he calls them friends, in the fourteenth verſe, <hi>And all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you;</hi> here is the fruit of Chriſts friendſhip; you are my friends, and here is the fruit of my love to you; he doth not ſay, I have called you friends, therefore I will give you great poſſeſſions in the World; no, but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you; for Jeſus Chriſt to make known theſe bleſſed things that he hath heard of the Father, that are kept from the wiſe of the world, this is the fruit of Chriſts friendſhip; therefore though Chriſt doth not give you Poſſeſſions in the world, though you bee poor and mean, yet you may be dear friends to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How ſhall I know this?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Why? if Chriſt reveals to your ſouls thoſe great things of eternal life that he hath heard from the Father, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you are the friends of Jeſus Chriſt; oh that wee could exerciſe our faith in this Prophetical Office of Chriſt, in which he is wonderful; when you would exerciſe faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, exerciſe your faith upon him as a Prophet; Lord, I am weak and dull, but Lord thou haſt anoynted thine own Son to reveal unto me thy will, as much as concerns my everlaſting good; look upon Jeſus Chriſt as the wonder of the world in all theſe things, in his Kingly, Prieſtly, and Prophetical Office, and then doe you honour the Son of God as the Son of God, when you look thus upon him. And
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168883:56"/> then another Scripture wee have in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt mee, and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, and have known ſurely that I come out from thee, and they have beleeved that thou didſt ſend mee.</hi> When I was in thy boſome from eternity, thou gaveſt mee ſuch words, and diddeſt put this upon mee, that I ſhould reveal thy will to ſuch and ſuch, and every particular one was mentioned unto Chriſt, whom ſuch words ſhould bee made known too; ſaith Chriſt, I have done it, <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt mee,</hi> and therefore Chriſt hee is called the <hi>Word,</hi> eſpecially in regard of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Office, <hi>The Word was made Fleſh, the Word was God;</hi> Chriſt comes to rexeal the minde of his Father unto the children of men; as by the words of a man, the minde and counſels, and thoughts of a man come to bee made known, ſo Chriſt was the <hi>Word</hi> of God; though I ſay not that this is all the ſenſe from that, but there is a higher ſenſe; but this is one thing aimed at, that by him the counſels of God come to bee made known to the children of men, therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That no man knows the Father but the Son, and him to whom the Son ſhall reveal him:</hi> Hee comes to reveal God to the children of men. And that may bee a third particular.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The wonder of Chriſts Prophetical Office, it is in the great things that hee is ſent to reveal, in the high things, the ſupernatural things, things that are ſo infinitely above the reach of reaſon. Let a man bee elevated unto the greateſt height of reaſon, hee is not able to reach into the myſteries of godlineſs, no, as the Apoſtle ſaith in a place in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> before named, it muſt bee the Spirit of God that ſearches the deep things of God; now this is the Spirit of God that is ſent from the Father and the Son, that ſearches the deep things of God, they are deep, high, ſupernatural, glorious things that Jeſus Chriſt doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; Oh there are unſearchable riches, the Apoſtle calls the Goſpel, <hi>Unſearchable riches,</hi> rich things that have no footſteps at all in the creature; wee can never come by any

When Chriſt was performing that Prophetical Office of his, the Text ſaith, <hi>That all wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth;</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, Oh here are wonderful things indeed, theſe are ſecret things indeed that wee were not taught, they all did wonder at the gracious things that proceeded out of his mouth. It is true, before Chriſt was Incarnate, there was ſomewhat of the myſtery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and our fore-fathers that were ſaved, were ſaved by the ſame Goſpel, but the knowledge of the glorious my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel were kept hid till that great Prophet ſhould come into the world, and that is a ſpecial reaſon why all the time before the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, there was ſo little knowledge; God, and the way of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life was known ſo little, becauſe the Lord would reſerve the Revelation of himſelf, and thoſe great Counſels of his Will concerning mans eternal eſtate, hee would reſerve them for the great Prophet to come to reveal, and when Chriſt came, then broke forth light into the world; and as Chriſt comes to any place, ſo there breaks forth the light of thoſe glorious ſupernatural things that are above the reach of reaſon, yea ſuch things as Angels could never have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, therefore I remember it is ſaid in one place. That thoſe things are made known to Angels by the Goſpel, the Lord ſending his Miniſters in his Name to preach thoſe things from Chriſt, that ſo the Angels come to underſtand further things in the myſtery of the Goſpel, than they did before; therefore they are things above the reach of any mens underſtanding whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And eſpecially, it will make the Prophetical Office of Chriſt wonderful, if wee adde to this a fourth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,

All things are delivered to mee;</hi> ſo that Chriſt here makes the revelation of God unto babes, to bee the fruit of Gods delivering up all things to him; <hi>All things are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to mee, and no man knoweth the Father but the Son, and him to whom the Son will reveal him;</hi> ſo that Chriſt having received all power from the Father, upon this it is that theſe babes come to have ſuch underſtanding in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of godlineſs, and the wiſe of the world never come to underſtand.</p>
                     <p>And then that is very remarkable as wee go along, that upon this ground Jeſus Chriſt doth invite ſouls to come to him, <hi>Come unto mee all yee that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay thus, Conceive now as if Jeſus Chriſt were preaching now perſonally to you, and hee were ſaying thus to you, All power is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to mee by the Father, and as a fruit of this, that the Father hath committed to mee, I do reveal him to whom I pleaſe, and none can know the Father but by mee, I have the diſpenſation of all the treaſures of wiſdome, and the revelation of all the myſteries of eternal life from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Oh therefore come to mee, come to mee all yee that labour, and are heavy laden; you labour under the burden of your ignorance, perhaps you complain, alas, I do not know God, nor underſtand the great myſteries of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; I pray, and hear, and yet I cannot come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

                     <p n="5">5 But further, Chriſt is a wonderful Prophet in this, that hee reveals things many times ſuddenly, hee is not bound to thoſe wayes that any man or Angel is bound to; if a man or Angel would come to inſtruct others in the truths of the Goſpel, they muſt inſtruct them by degrees, to underſtand one thing at once, and another at another time, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct one thing from another in that way, but Chriſt hee can make known the things of eternal life in an inſtant to the ſoul. Whoſoever comes to Chriſt, muſt bee convinced of ſin, and bee emptied of himſelf, and bee humbled, all theſe things are in every ſoul that comes to Chriſt; now all theſe things may by one beam of light bee wrought that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall let into the ſoul. As an Apothecary may get the very quinteſſence of all herbs in one drop, though you cannot ſee the herbs: ſo Jeſus Chriſt I ſay, ſometimes by one beam of light lets in a hundred truths into the ſoul, ſo that they do apprehend the ſubſtance of all thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars that are ſpoken of, and there is a proportionable work upon their hearts to bring them to Chriſt; is not this a wonderful work of Chriſt? that a man that hath been an ignorant, ſottiſh blinde creature, a prophane ungodly man, hating all godlineſs, perhaps hee comes to hear a Sermon meerly to ſcorn, as many have done, this man comes in the very heat of his wickedneſs, ſo that a man would wonder that ſome fruit of Gods wrath comes not from heaven to ſtrike him into the bottomleſs pit, yet it may bee at this very Sermon, there ſhall bee ſome one beam of light dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into his ſpirit, that may work his ſoul to heaven, poſſibly,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:168883:58"/> if hee ſhould dye at that inſtant; though it is true, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily God begins to ſtir firſt, and doth it not all at once, but yet ſometimes ſome that come into a Congregation moſt ignorant and ſottiſh, and know no other God but Mammon and luſts, and yet coming to the word, at one inſtant God darts in that light into his ſpirit, as this man comes to have his heart turned to God, and comes to know his miſery, and to know the way of ſalvation, and the Covenant of Grace, but not diſtinctly. It may bee after this beam of light is darted in, God may come over again diſtinctly, and reveal to him his miſerable eſtate by nature, and humble him more, and ſo hee may have a little glimpſe of this at one Sermon, and a little more at another, but at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant there may bee that let into the heart, that poſſibly may unite the heart to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſave it if it ſhould dye at that preſent; here is a wonderful work in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And then Chriſt is wonderful in his Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in this, he teaches the heart; no men, nor Angels, can teach the heart, but Jeſus Chriſt; though men, or Angels may preſent truths before another man, and ſo convince the underſtanding, yet there is no men, nor Angels, can bee able to ſay thus, I will ſo make known ſuch a truth to this man or woman, as I will gain his heart by it, it ſhall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his heart into the very image of that truth that I ſhall preſent unto him, no man, nor Angel can do it; but Chriſt hee teaches ſo as no man teaches, <hi>Job</hi> 36.22. <hi>Behold God exalteth by his power, who teacheth like him?</hi> Now God teacheth by Chriſt in the adminiſtration of his Prophetical Office. Man may come and tell us, this and the other thing ought to bee done; Oh but who teaches like Jeſus Chriſt? none teaches the heart but Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Job</hi> 38.36. <hi>Who hath put wiſdome in the inward parts, or who hath given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the heart?</hi> certainly none living, no Angel can do it, nor no man can do it, it is onely Jeſus Chriſt in the adminiſtration of his Prophetical Office, it is hee that teaches, and prevails with the heart when hee comes with
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168883:59"/> truths, therefore when you ſee people come to hear many truths, and ſit under a clear and diſtinct Miniſtry that opens many truths unto them, it may bee many will get brain-knowledge that ſhall make them to confer about thoſe truths, but yet not changed: you will ſay, What ſhould bee the reaſon why they that have ſo much knowledge live wickedly? why here is the ground, Jeſus Chriſt hee hath not exerciſed this Prophetical Office of his ſo far upon them, to over-power their hearts, Here is the reaſon why ſuch men have had knowledge in the brain, and yet lived wickedly a long time; yet if they belonged to Chriſt, at ſome other time they ſhall come to hear the Word of God, they ſhall hear the very ſame truths they heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and perhaps delivered in a weaker manner than they have heard it, and yet their hearts ſhall bee a hundred times more wrought upon at that time than ever they were wrought upon before. Sometimes a man comes by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent into a Congregation, and hears a Miniſter upon ſuch a ſubject, and it may bee a Miniſter by the by ſpeaks of ſomething that hee little thought of perhaps before hee came up, and this man hath heard the ſame truth largely handled, perhaps many Tractates about it heretofore, and his heart never touch'd, but now hearing it mentioned by the by his heart is mightily wrought upon, and he goes away, and ſaith, Verily God is in this place. What is the reaſon? why here Chriſt ſpeaks to the heart, and before man only ſpoke to the ear, this is a wonderful thing in the Prophetical Office of Chriſt, that hee ſpeaks to the heart; and thus ſhould wee exerciſe our faith upon Chriſt in this, when wee come to the Word, look upon Chriſt by the eye of faith as the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Church, that teaches ſo as no man teaches, that doth not onely ſpeak unto the ear, but ſpeaks unto the heart.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168883:59"/> in verſ. 1. <hi>The former Treatiſe have I made, O</hi> Theophilus, <hi>of all that Jeſus began both to do and teach;</hi> why <hi>Luke</hi> is hee that writ the Goſpel, and the Acts, hee writ the ſumme of what Chriſt did teach in the whole courſe of his life, and yet here hee tells us that hee did make a Treatiſe, and did relate what Jeſus <hi>Began</hi> to do and teach; if one ſhould have ſaid to <hi>Luke,</hi> Why, did you not relate all that Jeſus did do, and preach? why Chriſt is dead now. But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this, That indeed all that Chriſt did preach perſonally when hee was here in the world, it was but a <hi>Beginning,</hi> Chriſt was to teach afterwards to the end of the world, and that hee was to do partly by his Miniſters that ſhould bee to the end of the world, hee doth exerciſe his Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by them.</p>
                     <p>And by the way, whenſoever you come to hear any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of God to reveal any thing of the Goſpel to you, you are to look upon it as Chriſt exerciſing his Prophetical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in this way; hee is wonderful in teaching in this, that hee doth not onely by inſtruments, but immediately him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf many times; where there is want of means, wee may there expect Jeſus Chriſt immediately to reveal the Will of his Father to thoſe ſouls that do belong to Election.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 And then Chriſt is wonderful in teaching, for hee teaches infallibly, which none can do. Likewiſe many other particulars might bee named in the wonder of Chriſts Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office, but time doth ſlip mee, therefore wee will proceed to the next thing in the wonder of Chriſt, onely take this along with you, That in your beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt, you muſt beleeve in him as Chriſt, that is Anointed by the Father, King, Prieſt, and Prophet; and when you exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your faith upon him in all theſe three of his Offices, then you will know what it is rightly to beleeve indeed.

                        <hi>Chriſt wonderful in his Glorious indowments and excellency of his Perſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But further, Chriſt he is the Wonder of the World, in regard of thoſe glorious endowments and excellencie of his Perſon, thoſe Perſonal endowments and excellencies that he had; and herein he is the Wonder of the World.</p>
                     <p>Now the endowments and excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt they are great and glorious, <hi>Thou art fairer than the children of men.</hi> It is he that received the Spirit without meaſure, it is he that had the Treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him bodily, and he muſt needs bee the Wonder of the World; that Scripture in the ſecond of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> doth ſhew unto us what a wonderful Saviour we have, it is ſuch an expreſſion that had wee not had it from the Holy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168883:61"/> Ghoſt we ſhould never have dared to have ventured upon it, as in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge;</hi> and then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily;</hi> what an high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is here? All the fulneſſe of the God-head doth dwell bodily in Jeſus Chriſt; ſurely he hath excellent endowments then, he is filled with glorious things, his Human Nature is elevated and inlarged to the higheſt capacity that a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have to receive excellency. And God hath raiſed up the Humane Nature of Chriſt to ſhew how high he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to elevate a Creature, and make it capable for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Glory, that he might declare it to Angels and Saints to all eternity; I ſay, mans nature is raiſed to that height, that God might to all eternity make known to the Angels and Saints this thing, and ſay, Behold to what a height is mine infinite power able to raiſe a Creature, to be capable of happineſſe? Therefore Chriſts Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo raiſed, and our nature in him, which ſhould be a wonderful comfort to us, that our nature ſhould be raiſed to ſo much glory in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And a great argument to us, to take heed of the abuſe of Humane Nature, of thy Body, and of thy Soul; oh that ever any one ſhould bee given up to that ſottiſhneſſe, that is, a man that hath Humane nature in him, that ſhould look after no greater good than meerly to eat, and drink, and play, and ſatisfie his luſt; doſt thou know oh Creature that thy nature is raiſed to ſuch an height of excellency, that God might declare to Angels and men what his power was able to doe? and ſhalt thou that haſt the ſame Nature, that art a kin (as it were) to Chriſt, ſhalt thou bee ſo baſe and vile, to mind thy filthy and baſe luſts, and mind no higher good than this? the very thought of the raiſing our Nature in Chriſt, it is a mighty argument to raiſe up the thoughts of one that is a man, to a higher pitch than ever they have been; think thus, certainly my nature is capable of ſome higher good than meerly to ear and drink, and play, and to have a little Mony here for a while; why now
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168883:61"/> that ſhewes the perſonal excellency and endowments of Chriſt in general, that all the fulneſs of the God-head doth dwell bodily in him, and therefore Chriſt hee is called the Character, and the ingraven form of the Image of God, in the firſt of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> it is not ſaid ſo of man; though man be ſaid to be made according to Gods Image, yet it is never ſaid of him, That he is the brightneſſe of Gods glory, and the expreſſe Image of his Perſon, ſo as it is ſaid of Chriſt; and in the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> you have mighty high expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about the Perſonal excellency of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.15. Who <hi>is the Image of the inviſible God, the firſt born of every Creature;</hi> and then he is the beginning of all things, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>He is the Image of the inviſible God,</hi> as God and man, for ſo I muſt ſpeak of him; he is the Image of the inviſible God in another manner, and more fully, than any creature is, or poſſibly can be, for Jeſus Chriſt, take him God and Man, he hath the very character and ingraven form of whatſoever glory there is in the Father; I ſay, take him as God and Man, as thus, hee hath an omnipotency in him, therefore it is ſaid in the third of the <hi>Philippians</hi> latter end, <hi>Who ſhall change our vild bodie that it may be faſhioned like unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body,</hi> (how) <hi>according to the working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi> Now this is a great Myſtery of godlineſſe, that God-Man ſhould have an Omnipotency in him; and then likewiſe he hath the expreſſe Image of all the knowledge of God: for as he is God-man, he is made the Judge of all the World, and hee will bee the Judge, not meerly as he is God, but as God and Man; now ſeeing hee is the Judge of all the World hee muſt have an infinite knowledge, he muſt know the hearts of men, and all the works of men; and he muſt have an infinite Holineſſe and Juſtice that muſt judge all the World. And thus God-man hath an expreſſe Character of the Attributes of God, which none elſe hath; and then he hath an expreſſe character of the Immenſity of God. If you ſpeak of his Body, it cannot be every where, but God-Man is in all places; thus you have it in the third of <hi>John,</hi> verſ. 13. it is a very ſtrange
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:168883:62"/> expreſſion, and it can never bee underſtood but by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the perſonal union of the two Natures. Why at that time hee was ſpeaking to them there upon the earth, and yet ſaith hee, <hi>The Son of man which is in heaven.</hi> At this time hee that is the Son of man is in heaven, his body could not bee in two places at once, but God-man was then in heaven. Thus you ſee the excellency of Chriſt, in being the character of the Father, and having the Divine Attributes in him in another manner than any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world could have that is a meer creature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And then further, this perſonal excellency of Chriſt will appear, when wee conſider how Chriſt comes to have thoſe excellencies, that hee hath them all by vertue of the perſonal union. The humane Nature alone it is but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if you take it diſtinct; But now this humane nature is filled with all excellency from the Father; and indeed the Father is the fountain of all firſtly; theſe excellencies that Chriſt hath, they come from the perſonal union im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; now God unto other creatures gives them as it were of bounty out of himſelf, hee doth confer from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hee puts forth an act of power for the beſtowing of ſuch and ſuch excellencies upon ſuch creatures, but when the humane nature of Chriſt was to bee filled with ſuch excellencies, it is by taking of the humane nature of Chriſt into himſelf, as wee ſay concerning ſight. Philoſophers have a diſpute whether it bee by taking in the ſpecies, or by ſending out ſomething from the eye. This may a little reſemble this great myſtery, there are ſome things that God beſtows by ſending out from himſelf, other excellencies hee beſtows by taking in to himſelf: Now all other creatures, Angels and men (but onely the humane nature of Chriſt) have all the excellency that they have by Gods ſending out from himſelf; but now all the indowments of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his excellencies, hee hath them all from God taking of him into himſelf, that is, in a peſonal union, not taking him into communion with himſelf as his Saints, but taking him into a perſonal union, and ſo comes to have all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168883:62"/> in another manner than any other creature can poſſibly have.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is wonderful, take him God and man, in this, That all his perſonal excellencies that hee hath, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon himſelf; hee is Independent, the excellency that Chriſts humane nature hath, it is, I ſay, Independent in this, that is, it depends upon his perſon; there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the excellency that Chriſt hath, but upon the very perſon of Chriſt himſelf, all depends upon him, for hee ſaith of himſelf, <hi>That hee hath life in himſelf,</hi> ſo you have it in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.27.</note> it is ſpoken concerning Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency there, <hi>For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath hee given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> Indeed the Son is from the Father by an eternal generation; but now though hee bee firſtly from the Father, yet now the Son hath life in himſelf, yea and eternally hee had life in himſelf, and ſo what excellency the humane nature hath, it doth depend upon its own perſon, which is a higher and a more glorious way of having excellency, than it is poſſible for any thing elſe to have.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 And then in the fourth place, hence Chriſt, even God man, hee comes to bee worthy of Divine honour, Divine honour is due to Jeſus Chriſt that is God-man; there is no creature can partake of Divine honour by coming never ſo near to God, but onely the humane nature of Chriſt being perſonally united: Let a childe of God, a Saint, bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo holy, becauſe hee comes to partake of ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of holineſs, hee is not therefore to partake of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour, nor an Angel; but now Chriſt, God and man, the very humane nature joyned with the Divine in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal union, comes to ſhare in the Divine honour that is due to him both God and man, and it is a wonderful Work of God to bring that that is in its ſelf but a creature, to come to have a ſhare in Divine honour.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And then Chriſt is wonderful in this, that hence hee is an infinite object of the Delight of his Father, not onely as hee is eternally begotten of the Father, but as hee is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168883:63"/> both God and man,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.17.</note> 
                        <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> I am pleaſed fully in him, Jeſus Chriſt is an object even adequate to the very heart of God the Father; Oh how ſhould wee take content in him! certainly if hee bee ſo excellent as hee is, as to give full ſatisfaction to God the Father, then hee may very well give full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and God the Father manifeſts his ſatisfaction ſo fully in him, that hee hath made him to bee heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and therefore hee is ſaid, <hi>to bee the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all things,</hi> all do ſubſiſt by him.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and further, there is that ſatisfaction that the Father hath in him, that God the Father did make all things for his ſake; I ſay, all things in the world are made for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, Angels are made for his ſake, and this world, and ſeas, all the work that ever God did, or will do to all eternity, it was for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, that God the Father might honour himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt; that Text is very full for that, and wee need no more, in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>All things were created by him, and for him.</hi> So that God hath a higher end in creating the world than you think for, God did not onely create that hee might manifeſt that hee was a mighty God, and merciful, and bountiful, and the like, but God had a higher end when hee made the world, it was to advance his Son, when hee made the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, God would never have made them, but for the honour of his Son.</p>
                     <p>Oh what infinite cauſe have wee to honour Jeſus Chriſt; Oh how happy are they that live to the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, by whom God may have glory beyond a natural way! did you conſider this, that you were made for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Jeſus Chriſt, and the honour that God the Father would have from you is this, that you ſhould live to the honour of his Son, and all other honour that you give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, except it bee in order to his Son, it is not accepted, I ſay, whatſoever honour any man or woman doth endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give to God, is not accepted of him, but in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168883:63"/> to the honour of Jeſus Chriſt; therefore if you look at God in a meer natural way, and honour, and worſhip him never ſo much, as the heathens did, all this would not do; but now that honour that God hath in reference to his Son, when a poor ſinner is ſenſible of the breach that ſin hath made between him and the infinite God, and comes to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, and ſeeks to advance Jeſus Chriſt by faith, I ſaith God, here is the honour that I would have. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when all the elect ones that were given to Jeſus Chriſt to redeem, when they are all converted and brought to Jeſus Chriſt, the world will fall about our ears, why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſaith God, I have the end that I made the world for, and now I have brought in all that do belong to my Son, and all thoſe works by which my Son will come to have his honor eternally are done, let there be an end of the world, and the end of the world is like to be the ſooner now; becauſe that we ſee God is doing ſo much for the ſetting up of Jeſus Chriſt in this latter age; as when a mans time is almoſt at an end for his work, then hee doth work more ſpeedily than hee did before; now ſaith God, I have made the world for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Son, but yet to this day how little honour hath my Son had from the world? and there is a time, ſaith God, that I will manifeſt to all the world that I did make it for Jeſus Chriſt, hee did not make it for a company of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to do what they would in, nor for a company of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane people, to eat and drink, and follow their luſts in, but the end at which God aimed at in making the world, ſaith hee, I will ſet up my Son in the world, and all the works that ever have been done in the world, ſhall at length come in to conduce to the honour of my Son. And this ſhall bee the great work that ſhall bee done at the Day of Judgement, hee will ſhew to all the world how all thoſe works that did ſeem to go moſt againſt Jeſus Chriſt, how they were brought about for the honour of Jeſus Chriſt: Oh bleſſed are thoſe ſouls that come to ſee that all things were made for the honour of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo give glory to him accordingly.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE proceed: The Name of Chriſt is Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in regard of the wonderful glory of the Father that ſhines in him; It is in Jeſus Chriſt that God reveals himſelf, and appears both to men and Angels: It is true, ſomewhat wee might know of the <hi>inviſible things of God by the things that are ſeen,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. by his great Works of Creation and Providence: but there is as much difference between the Glory of God that ſhines in all his Works of Creation and Providence, and the Glory of God that ſhines in the face of Chriſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the glittering of a Glow-worm in a dark night, and the glory of the Sun in the full ſtrength of it. Now onely
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168883:65"/> take this along with you, that God expects that thoſe that do ſee his glory in Chriſt, ſhould glorifie him in another manner than thoſe that ſee his glory onely ſhining in the Works of Creation and Providence; that as there is much difference between the ſhining of the Sun in its full ſtrength, and a Glow-worm, even ſo there ſhould bee as much difference between beleevers glorifying God, and heathens, as there is between the Glow-worm, and the glory of the Sun; you ſhould not ſatisfie your ſelf except you finde that there is ſome ſuch proportionable difference; for certainly if you have ſeen God in Chriſt, you have ſeen him wonderfully indeed; therefore in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>But wee all with open face bebolding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> This Scripture hath very much in it, hee ſpeaks of the Goſpel, and compares that to a Glaſs, wherein the glory of God ſhines, ſo as wee may behold it with open face, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, as that we are changed into the very ſame image of it, from glory to glory, from one degree unto another. Wee may behold the glory of God in the glaſs of the creature, and never bee changed into the ſame image; but when wee behold the glory of God in the glaſs of the Goſpel, wee then come to bee changed into the ſame Image, and ſtill to bee changed more and more; and with open face wee do behold it. And in chap. 4. verſ. 6. <hi>For God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Mark it, hee is the knowledge of God, the <hi>light of the knowledge of God, and the light of the knowledge of the glory of God;</hi> and all this is, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; in the face of the creature there may bee the knowledge of God, but the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, this is in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Hee that hath ſeen mee, hath ſeen the Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Philip;</hi> It was a maxim among the Fathers in the time of the Law, that no man could ſee God, and live, God was ſo glorious,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168883:66"/> that they thought that hee could not bee ſeen, but it would overwhelm any creature that was in the fleſh that ſhould ſee him; but now mark in that Prophecy that wee have of the times of the Goſpel in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.3. There is a Prophecie of Chriſt that is apparent, <hi>The voice of him that cryeth in the wilderneſs, prepare yee the way of the Lord</hi> (which is in expreſs words applied to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Chriſt; And in the very ſame words) <hi>make ſtreight in the Deſart a high way for our God, every valley ſhall bee exalted, and every mountain ſhall bee made low, and the crooked ſhall bee made ſtreight, and the rough places plain;</hi> Then it follows in the fift verſe, <hi>And the glory of the Lord ſhall bee revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together;</hi> before no man could ſee God and live, Fleſh was not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God, but now when the <hi>Word was made Fleſh,</hi> when the times of the Goſpel came wherein God would make himſelf appear through his Son more clearly and fully, now all Fleſh ſhall ſee it, ſhall ſee the glory of the Lord; now the glory of God appears wonderfully in Chriſt in theſe four or five particulars.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Power of God appears in Chriſt.</note>Firſt, The glory of Gods Attributes do ſhine more brightly in the face of Chriſt than any other wayes; As for inſtance, The power of God appears infinitely more in Chriſt, than in making heaven and earth; for God to unite God and man together in one Perſon, is a greater work than making heaven and earth; there is more power of God put forth in the hypoſtatical union of the Natures of Chriſt, beſides all the power of God that appears in the great Works that Chriſt did do, and in carrying Chriſt through all thoſe great Works that hee was carried through, than in making of heaven and earth. There is more power of God appears in the converſion of one ſoul to Chriſt, than in making heaven and earth: Then what power of God appears in Chriſt himſelf?</p>
                     <p>And the wiſdome of God appears more in Chriſt, than in the creation of heaven and earth.<note place="margin">The Wiſdome of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Chriſt.</note> Now for God to finde out ſuch a glorious way of Reconciliation as hee hath
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:168883:66"/> found out in his Son, in this the wiſdome of God is more glorious than in all his works infinitely, the glory of Gods wiſdome in other things is darkned in compariſon of his wiſdome in this; If God had put it to Angels to finde out a way of Reconciliation, they could never have gueſt at ſuch a way as this is; that wee ſhould bee reconciled in Chriſt, here is the glory of wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>There likewiſe doth appear the glory of Gods holineſs more in Chriſt than in any other way; it is true,<note place="margin">The Holineſs of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Chriſt</note> the Law is a glaſs of Gods holineſs, and thoſe that caſt reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law, they ſpit in the very face of Gods holineſs; I but that is no ſuch glaſs as Jeſus Chriſt is, there wee ſee the holineſs of God in another manner than wee can do it in the holy Law that God hath made. God never ſhewed his hatred of ſin ſo much as hee did in Chriſt, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee deviſed by all Angels and men how it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have ſuch an Argument to manifeſt the hatred of ſin ſo as it is manifeſted in Chriſt, that God ſhould deal ſo with his Son, as hee hath done for the ſin of man; I ſay, if an infinite Wiſdome ſhould ſet it ſelf on work never ſo much to finde out an Argument to manifeſt the hatred of ſin, there could not bee a greater Argument: So that when God ſent his Son into the world to dye for mans ſin, hee did as it were ſay, I have many wayes to manifeſt my holineſs to the children of men, how infinitely I do hate ſin, but here is a way that it ſhall appear to the uttermoſt, they ſhall ſee it in my dealing with my Son; certainly in Chriſt Gods wiſdome hath found out an Argument to make us all to bee convinced of the infinite holineſs of God, that God hates ſin more than hell its ſelf, and that wee ſhould do ſo too.</p>
                     <p>Again, the Juſtice of God appears in Chriſt, more than in any thing elſe: It appears not ſo much in all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned, as in Gods dealings with Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Juſtice of God appears in Chriſt.</note> in that hee required ſuch ſatisfaction from him as hee did; when as wee hear of the dreadful curſes of the Law, and of the torments that are in hell, wee may thereby be put in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:168883:67"/> minde of an infinite Juſtice; Oh how righteous is God in his wayes there, and his Juſtice ſeems to bee wonderful unto us: But when you behold in this red glaſs of the blood of Chriſt, Gods Juſtice, it is a great deal more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious here, than in all the damned in hell. If God ſhould grant to any of you to ſtand upon the very brink of hell, and there to look into the pit, and ſee all the torments and tortures there, and hear all the cries there, then you think your hearts would bee affected with the Juſtice of God, to fear it. I but when God makes himſelf known to you in Chriſt, when you hear of the ſufferings of Chriſt for ſin, God would have you to bee more affected with his Juſtice, and to fear it more, than if you ſaw all the Torments of hell. And the truth is, there is no ſuch way to ſet out the Juſtice of God, as to ſhew the dealing of God with his Son for the ſin of man. If I would preach but one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that ſhould bee my laſt, of the Terribleneſs of Gods Juſtice, I would ſpeak of ſome Scripture that ſhould ſhew the terribleneſs of the dealing of God with his Son, and that would ſet out the Juſtice of God to bee a great deal more glorious than any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The glory of Gods Mercy appears in Chriſt.</note>And ſo the glory of Gods mercy and goodneſs is more in Chriſt than any other thing; wee injoy theſe outward comforts as a fruit of the bounty and goodneſs of God; I but what are all theſe to all the love of God in his Son? I remember a learned man compares all the good things wee receive from God, from his general bounty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and his love and mercy that appears in Chriſt, with a few ſparks that come out of a burning furnace, and the heat of it within; look what difference there is between them, ſuch difference is there between the love of God to us in all the comforts in this world, and the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt; God hee would have an Argument to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the infiniteneſs of his love unto his creatures, and no ſuch Argument as this, <hi>So God loved the world that hee ſent forth his onely begotten Son.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo the glory of Gods Truth that is manifeſted in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168883:67"/> fulfilling Promiſes,<note place="margin">The glory of Gods Truth appears in Chriſt.</note> any promiſe that is fulfilled manifeſts the glory of Gods truth and faithfulneſs, but now the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling that great Promiſe of God in ſending his Son into the world, here the truth and faithfulneſs of God appears more gloriouſly than in all other; for there was never a promiſe ſo difficult as this promiſe; many men can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to fulfil promiſes of ſmaller moment, when there is no great difficulty in the fulfilling of them, I but here is the greateſt Promiſe that ever was, and there was the greateſt difficulty for God to fulfil this promiſe of any thing that ever God did promiſe; and indeed when as wee hear that Chriſt was promiſed ſome four thouſand years before hee came into the world, and yet at length hee came into the world, it is a good Argument to teach us never to doubt of the fulfilling of Gods promiſes; And indeed the right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods faithfulneſs in this great Promiſe of his Son, will mightily ſtrengthen the faith of the people of God to beleeve any ſmaller promiſes, and not to ſtagger in them; and the reaſon why people are ſo ready to ſtagger in their beleef about ſmaller promiſes, it is becauſe they have not been acquainted with the work of faith in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving that great promiſe that God made with his people in ſending his Son into the world; ſo that theſe Attributes with all other, do ſhine gloriouſly in Chriſt. No marvel then though the Angels upon the birth of Chriſt, they cry out, <hi>Glory bee to God on high;</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, Oh Lord, Here is one come into the world, wherein thy glory doth appear, and by whom thou ſhalt have glory to all eternity: Though Chriſt was but a Babe in the Manger, yet the Angels did ſee more glory in him, than in the higheſt heavens; they did not ſee ſo much cauſe to cry, <hi>Glory bee to God on high,</hi> from any object that ever they ſaw, as when they ſaw the Babe in the Manger, then <hi>Oh glory bee to God on high,</hi> wee behold thy glory ſhining here, and bleſſed are thoſe that ſhall bee inabled to behold the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; who would not but have beheld the glory of God in his great works? what man
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:168883:68"/> or woman that hath any knowledge of God at all, would for a world but have beheld ſo much of the glory of God as doth appear in the great Works of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; Oh what comfort have the Saints in beholding the glory of the great God, when they look up unto heaven, and upon the earth, and in the ſeas! Oh but then the ſweetneſs, and ſoul-ſatisfaction that there muſt needs bee in the beholding the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
                     <p>And this by the way would bee a good evidence of your faith; have you beheld more of Gods glory in the face of Chriſt than ever you did in all the world beſides? Yea and hath the glory of God in the face of Chriſt, darkned all the glory of the world beſides unto you? Have your hearts been taken with that glory more, than with all the glory that there is in the world? Why here would bee a good evidence of faith indeed, that you have had a true and real fight of Jeſus Chriſt; wee cannot have a real ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, but wee muſt certainly ſee more of God in him, than in all things elſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The glory of Gods great works in bringing man to his eternal eſtate appears in Chriſt. Eph. 1.4.</note>And then ſecondly, As the glory of Gods Attributes, ſo the glory of the great Counſels and Works of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the governing of man unto his eternal eſtate, that appears in Chriſt above all.</p>
                     <p>As the great Counſels of God in Election, <hi>Wee are choſen in Chriſt,</hi> the great Counſels and Works of God in Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Juſtification, Adoption, Reconciliation, Sanctification, and Glorification, theſe are the great Works that God doth glorifie himſelf in, theſe are the great things that the thoughts and counſels of God hath been from all eternity exerciſed about, whatſoever your thoughts are exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, yet I ſay, the thoughts and counſels of God have been exerciſed from all eternity about theſe great Works of his, Election, Vocation, Juſtification, Adoption, Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, Sanctification, Glorification, all theſe Works whereby hee doth order and guide mankinde unto an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate. Now the glory of God in all theſe Works they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:168883:68"/> are in Chriſt, Chriſt hee is the head of our Election, and all are choſen in him; what is Vocation but a calling unto Chriſt, and revealing Chriſt to the ſoul? And ſo Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is in Chriſt ſtill: And wee are made children, adopted in him, and reconciled in him, and ſanctified through him, and are to bee glorified through him; all theſe great Works about which the heart of God is ſo much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, the glory of God in all theſe, it doth ſhine in the face of Chriſt, and without the knowledge of Chriſt wee could never come to know any of theſe things. What could the heathen know of Gods eternal Election, or Vocation, or Juſtification, or Adoption, or Glorification, to ſpeak ſuch words to the Heathens as theſe are in reference to God, it would bee barbariſm; But now theſe are the great things of God that are revealed to Chriſtians by Jeſus Chriſt, wee come to have all theſe glorious counſels of God in theſe great works of his to bee opened to us, and Chriſt is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in all them, and all thoſe that did know what theſe things mean, they ſee the glory of God wonderfully in them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the glory of God is wonderful in Chriſt, in that all the good and mercy that is in order to eternal life, that God communicates to the children of men, it is through Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now wee mentioned ſomewhat like to this in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when wee ſhewed Chriſts endowments, that from him wee have all Excellencies; But now I onely mention it to ſhew how the glory of God the Father is in him, becauſe that God hath appointed him for the communication of all the good that hee doth intend towards the children of men in order to eternal life; now the glory of God muſt needs bee eminent in him this way; for God accounts it a great part of his glory to communicate himſelf to his creatures, therefore that through which hee doth communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, muſt needs bee partaker of abundance of glory; God hath honoured Chriſt in this, that hee hath choſen him to bee the inſtrument of the conveyance of all ſaving good
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168883:69"/> to all the Elect. Now ſuppoſe there were a glaſs that all the beams of the Sun that ever could ſhine upon the world, were contracted in it, and no beam of the Sun could ſhine upon the world but thorow that glaſs, firſt it muſt come upon the glaſs, and ſhine thorow it, and ſo ſhine upon the world, ſurely this glaſs would bee very glorious. You may conceive of Chriſt thus, Conceive of God the Father as the Sun, and of all his elect ones as the world, and Jeſus Chriſt as the glaſs between the Father, and all the Elect; now all the beams of the love, and mercy, and goodneſs that ever ſhall come from God upon all his elect ones, they all come thorow this glaſs, thorow Jeſus Chriſt; Oh how glorious is Jeſus Chriſt, how wonderful is he then in that glory of the Father!</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The glory of the Father is wonderful in him in this, that God the Father attains unto his greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, the great deſign that God had in making of the world, and in the preſerving of the world; I ſay, God attains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by his Son, by Jeſus Chriſt, And that deſign would bee loſt, if Jeſus Chriſt did not bring things about for the glory of his Father. God hath made a world for his glory, and hee preſerves a World for his glory, but the main deſign that God had in making the world, and that hee hath in preſerving the world, it is to fetch about a great deſign that hee hath onely by Jeſus Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that the Father is ſo well pleaſed in his Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by him hee comes to attain the great deſign that hee hath in making the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>What is that?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truth it is, wee underſtand but little of it for the preſent, but wee know in the general it is this, That hee might have his elect ones eternally with himſelf to behold his face, and magnifie him together with Angels for his mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, that is the great deſign that God had; other men have great deſigns in their heads, but the greateſt deſign that God hath of all, it is to fetch about his honour in his Son, and to glorifie himſelf in his elect ones to all eternity, that is the great deſign for which hee made
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:168883:69"/> the world, without which hee would never have made it. And God, as I may ſo ſay, is well enough ſatisfied in the midſt of all the diſhonour that is done to him in this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corrupt world, with this conſideration, Well, but my Son doth drive on my deſign, and this pleaſeth mee; no matter though I bee diſhonoured, though my Name bee never ſo much blaſphemed in the world, yet my Son carries on my great deſign, and the glory I foreſee I ſhall have in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that great deſign of mine, it doth ſo pleaſe mee, that it is no great matter to mee what wicked men that belong not to mine Election do. Chriſt is wonderful in this, that hee carries on the great deſign that God had from all eternity in making the world.</p>
                     <p>And then laſtly, The glory of God is great in Chriſt, and therefore wonderful, becauſe it is through him that all the ſervices and praiſes that God hath from his elect ones, do all come through him: As there is a reflection of the glory of God in the deſcending of it, when it doth deſcend upon the elect through Chriſt, ſo in the aſcending of it again from beleevers it doth aſcend through Chriſt, there is as great a neceſſity that when we tender up any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God, that it ſhould come through Chriſt, as when God lets down any beams of his glory, that that ſhould come through Chriſt; Chriſt is as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, for God to come down as it were from heaven to us, and for us to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up to heaven through him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. laſt, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him bee glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus thoughout all Ages world without end. Unto him bee glory in the Church</hi> (but how) <hi>by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> except the glory that you tender up to God goes through Chriſt, God accounts not himſelf glorified in it; For whatſoever comes from God to you, except it comes through Chriſt, it will bee to little purpoſe; ſo whatſoever comes from you unto God, except it comes through his Son, it is not accepted of God; therefore oh how wonderful is Chriſt in this, That ſuch glory of the Attributes of God do ſhine in him? the great Counſels, and Works of God about mans eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate are all in him: And all the good that God communicates
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168883:70"/> to his elect ones, all is through him: And the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that God had from all eternity, hee doth attain it by his Son. Laſtly, All the honour that hee hath from all his elect ones, it is through his Son. How wonderful is Chriſt then in regard of the glory of the Father in him? onely as wee go along, remember that when wee ſet Chriſt thus before you, wee do it not meerly to your underſtandings, that you may conceive thus of Chriſt, but as an object of your faith, you muſt exerciſe your faith upon Chriſt, as ſuch a Chriſt in whom the glory of the Father doth ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chriſt Wonderful in his Humiliation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing is, Chriſt is wonderful in his Humiliation; and indeed this may ſeem to bee the greateſt Wonder of all, at leaſt to our ſenſe it is, eſpecially if wee do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what hath been ſaid before of Chriſt, what a Perſon Chriſt is; now to hear what wee ſhall hear of his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, will appear to bee an amazing, and an aſtoniſhing Wonder.</p>
                     <p>As firſt, The wonder of his Humiliation is in this, That Chriſt, God and man, as you have heard before, ſhould have all the ſins of all the elect ones from the beginning of the world, to the end of the world laid upon him. For ſuch a one as Chriſt is, infinitely beloved of the Father, and <hi>equal with the Father,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 2.6.</note> 
                        <hi>accounted it no robbery to bee equal with God,</hi> yet that he ſhould ſtand before God the Father with all the ſins of the Elect charged upon him, ſo the Scripture tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>For hee hath made him to bee ſin for us, who knew no ſin:</hi> Hee hath made him to bee ſin for us; for Chriſt to bee made a worm was a wonderful Humiliation, but for Chriſt to bee made ſin was a greater Humiliation than to bee made a worm; ſurely this muſt needs bee a wonder to all the Angels in heaven, for them to ſee ſuch a one, whom they knew to bee the eternal Son of God, equal with the Father, to ſtand before the Father cloathed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168883:70"/> at it were with all the ſins of the Elect. Wee read in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. a kinde of type of this, in verſ. 3. of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> he was <hi>cloathed with filthy Garments, and ſtood before the Angel,</hi> ſo Jeſus Chriſt ſtands cloathed with filthy Garments, hee that is <hi>cloathed with Majeſty and Glory,</hi> yet hee muſt come and ſtand cloathed with filthy Garments before the Father. For one to bee cloathed with filthy garments, and yet to bee in ſome room alone, that no body ſhould ſee him, is no great matter, but to ſee a great Prince to come out before the world cloathed with filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is a very great humiliation: But Chriſt that was infinitely above all the Princes in the world, hee comes and ſtands before Men and Angels, yea before God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cloathed with theſe filthy garments. For a man to have ſin upon him before other men it is no great matter, but for him to come into the preſence of God with ſin upon him, it is a terrible thing. But now the Son of God muſt do it, hee comes into the preſence of the Father, and ſtands with all the ſins of the Elect upon him, what an object is here of Wonder? <hi>Luther</hi> calls Chriſt the greateſt ſinner that ever was in the world, I confeſs that is ſomewhat hard, for it was but charged upon him, but his meaning is onely this that I am ſpeaking of: Chriſt had not onely the ſins of <hi>David,</hi> his Murther and Adultery, and denial of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the like, but all the ſins of all the elect ones, from the beginning of the world, to the end of the world, which they were, or ſhould bee guilty of, charged upon him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The wonder of Chriſts Humiliation it is in this, that hee that was ſo high ſhould bee now brought down ſo low for the ſin of man; is not this a wonder, that hee that thunders in the heavens, ſhould bee cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Manger? Is it not a great wonder, that hee that framed the heavens and earth, ſhould work with a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Trade; that hee that is the great Judge of all the world ſhould bee accuſed, and ſhould bee condemned as a Malefactor, and crucified among Theeves? That hee that is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168883:71"/> the Lord of Life ſhould dye, that hee that dwelt in that light that is unapprochable, ſhould have darkneſs to cover him, that hee that is the bleſſed God ſhould bee made a curſe for the ſin of man, are not theſe things wonderful in Chriſtian Religion? and yet all theſe are things that may bee ſaid of Chriſt; for the Lord of Life to come and dye, and that accurſed death, this was a wonder that all the world ſeemed to bee affected with, the very inſenſitive creatures; for at the death of Chriſt the Sun withdrew his light as being amazed with this wonder, not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, and the earth ſhaked and trembled, and the graves opened at this wonder, the very ſtones clave in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this wonder; there was ſuch a mighty concuſſion of things at this time, that it made one that knew nothing of the cauſe of it, One <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> ſeeing the darkneſs at that time,<note place="margin">Aut Deus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae patitur aut mundi machina diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvetur.</note> and ſuch great things which were done, cry out, Certainly either the God of Nature ſuffers at this time, or the world is at an end. So great a wonder it was that the Lord of Life ſhould thus dye an accurſed death; Angels, yea all inſenſitive creatures they ſtood amazed at it, and ſeemed to bee exceedingly affected with it.</p>
                     <p>And then in the third place, Why, Chriſt may dye, and yet not ſuffer ſo much to make us wonder, many of the ſervants of God have died cruel deaths; But then in the third place, There is a greater wonder in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>iſts humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than in the ſufferings of the ſervants of God, becauſe though their bodies ſuffered, yet they had much freedome in their ſouls, they were filled with joy and comfort in the time of their ſufferings, ſo it was in the Martyrs; Oh but it was otherwiſe with Chriſt, though hee were the fountain of all conſolation, yet Chriſt ſuffers in his ſoul, hee was ſorrowful in his ſoul to the very death, hee gave his ſoul to bee an offering for ſin, and indeed the ſuffering of Chriſts ſoul, was the ſoul of his ſuffering, the chief of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when as Chriſt was in the Garden, there hee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that his ſoul was compaſſed round about with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.38.</note> 
                        <hi>his ſoul was very ſorrowful;</hi> and in another Evangeliſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:168883:71"/> hee began <hi>to bee amazed,</hi> and a third Evangeliſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mark 14.33.</note> hee <hi>began to bee filled with ſorrow in his ſoul,</hi> and the very trouble of his ſoul was that that drew forth from him ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſweat as never was heard of in the world before, nor never ſince, nor never is like to bee, that a man from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and trouble of his ſoul ſhould ſweat ſo: Many a man when hee is in fear and trouble of minde, hee may ſweat; but when did you ever hear of a man out of trouble of minde that did ſweat blood, that blood ſhould come and break through his skin, and run down upon him, and this through the trouble of his minde? for there was no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily affliction upon Chriſt then, but meerly the trouble of his Spirit, and hee knowing what cup hee was to drink, and the trouble that hee ſuffered in his Soul, did cauſe the blood to break through his veyns, and come to trickle down; and not ſome thin blood, for ſo I have read of one in <hi>Paris</hi> that was condemned to dye, and the very trouble of his ſpirit did cauſe ſome blood to come out of his body, but thin; but the Scripture tells us that there was clodders of blood; and when was this ſweat? when hee was abroad in the night time, and lay upon the ground, and in the Winter ſeaſon: In a Winters night when hee was abroad, and lay upon the ground, hee ſweat this ſweat, and all from the trouble of his ſpirit: A man may ſweat in Summer, and in Winter in the day time, or in a warm room, or in a bed, but for Chriſt in a Winters night, and lying upon the ground to ſweat ſuch a ſweat, for clodders of blood to trickle down,<note place="margin">☜</note> never was Garden watered as this Garden; now who would not have accounted this a Wonder of all Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</p>
                     <p>Here upon this ground lyes groveling the Son of God, the ſame God that made the heavens and earth, lyes here in trouble and anguiſh of his Spirit, while hee ſweat clod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of blood; certainly there was ſome great matter upon the Spirit of Chriſt at this time. Wee know it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, a Porter when hee hath a great burden upon his body, hee carries it while hee ſweats again: Oh but when
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:168883:72"/> you ſee Porters ſweating under their burdens, remember Jeſus Chriſt ſweating under the burden of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Beſides that other expreſſion, <hi>If it bee poſſible let this cup paſs from mee,</hi> and then the ſecond time, and the third time to do it again: Why the Martyrs have gone chearfully to their deaths, whoſe deaths have been as cruel as the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and more cruel for the outward part of it, but here even the great Champion from whom all the Martyrs that ever were, had their ſtrength, hee, when hee comes to dye, <hi>If it bee poſſible let this cup paſs from mee,</hi> ſaith hee; certainly hee ſaw that which the Martyrs never ſaw: Hee ſuffered in his Soul.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſt hee ſuffered theſe things from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that makes the wonder greater, and ſo his ſufferings greater; hee did not ſuffer onely from wicked men and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, men indeed they are like themſelves malicious, the devils are like themſelves cruel, I but Chriſt hee might have looked up to his Father, and have ſaid, But oh bleſſed Father,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.17.</note> thou haſt ſaid from heaven, that I am thy well-beloved Son: Chriſt would have accounted it no great matter to have ſuffered from men or devils, ſo bee it that his Father had ſhined upon him; Oh no, but here is the wonder, and the greateſt thing for Angels, and men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at, that God the Father hee inflicts theſe ſufferings with his own hand upon him, and the chief ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt they were inflicted by the very hand of God the Father himſelf; for a King to come and take his own childe, and ſcourge him, and put him to death with his own hand, wee would ſay, There was never ſuch a thing heard of! yet thus it was in the work of our Redemption, God the Father takes Chriſt with his own hands, and puts him to death, <hi>For hee made his Soul an offering for ſin,</hi> it was hee <hi>that bruiſed him:</hi> If you read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. you ſhall finde it was the Father that did it; And that was typified in <hi>Abrahams</hi> coming with his knife to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son, was not that a wonderful thing, that ſtory of <hi>Abraham? Iſaac</hi> muſt bee ſacrificed, and <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:168883:72"/> his onely Son with his own hands, what a ſtrange hiſtory is that? but that was but the type, here is the Antitype, here God the Father takes his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his onely Son Chriſt, and ſacrifices him himſelf; ſurely there was ſome great thing to bee done, that God the Father ſhould do it thus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Not onely God hee comes himſelf upon him, and inflicts theſe evils, but hee doth not ſpare him at all.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay, If God himſelf muſt bee the Executioner, and come and lay his hand upon him, hee will lay his hand gently upon his own Son. Nay, when Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God came to take our ſins upon him, the Father would not ſpare him one whit, but lets out the fulneſs of Juſtice upon him, lets out his Juſtice to the full, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. it is ſaid, <hi>That God ſpared not his own Son,</hi> certainly if God would have ſpared any, one would have thought it ſhould have been his Son: Oh here behold the Juſtice of God the Father, that when his own Son takes ſin upon him, and that by imputation, hee muſt pay to the uttermoſt farthing to Juſtice, yea though hee <hi>prayed with ſtrong cryings and tears,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. Though it is true, the Father did carry him through, yet in this God would not ſpare him, notwithſtanding any of his cryes, but hee muſt ſuffer to the uttermoſt, and pay the uttermoſt farthing that Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did require for the ſatisfying of it for mans ſins.

What thoughts muſt the Angels in He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ven have upon this when they ſee him whom they knew to bee the eternal Son of God under the hand of the Father, and the Father not ſo much as to ſpare him in any thing? Certainly if wee do not know theſe things, or beleeve them, if wee think to put off God lightly,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:168883:73"/> if wee think that a few cryes to God at laſt will bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cauſe God to ſpare us, and paſs by all our ſins, do but know God in Chriſt, and a thouſand of thy vain thoughts about God, and the pacifying God for thy ſin, will vaniſh away and come to nothing, did wee but know God aright in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Yea but yet further, there is a further wonder in this humiliation of Chriſt. God did not ſpare him; I but when God deals thus with his Son, will hee leave him? For one to ſuffer much, yea and though it bee much from God, yet ſo long as they may have the preſence of God with them, that God doth not leave them it is not ſo much. But in all theſe ſufferings, God the Father leaves him, this is that is expreſt by that ſpeech, that wonderful ſpeech of Chriſt upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken mee;</hi> There was never a ſpeech ſpoke in this world that had matter of ſo much admiration as that ſpeech of Jeſus Chriſt that was the eternal Son of God,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.46.</note> in the middeſt of his ſufferings, that hee ſhould thus cry out, certainly hee did not miſtake, what Chriſt apprehended to bee, was, wee many time may apprehend that God hath forſaken us, when there is no ſuch thing, but certainly Chriſt was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his apprehenſions, but what hee did apprehend, it was true: But now what this forſaking of God was, it is a very hard thing, a great myſtery, which is too deep for us to dive into, but that there was a forſaking, and that hee was not deceived, but that hee apprehended was real, that muſt needs bee granted, or otherwiſe wee muſt grant that Chriſt was deceived, which would bee blaſphemy for us to ſay.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Yea again yet further, the wonder in Chriſts humiliation was this, that all this Chriſt foreſaw, and yet did willingly undertake it to ſave mankinde, ſee what the heart of Chriſt in his ſufferings towards his elect ones, was, that rather than hee would ſee them to bee plunged into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs gulf of eternal miſery, hee would put himſelf into it to keep them out, hee did it willingly; When hee did
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:168883:73"/> fir ſtundertake this great work with his Father, hee knew what hee ſhould ſuffer, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared mee, it is written in the volume of thy book I ſhould do thy will,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10 5, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>and lo I come, I delight to do thy will,</hi> And what was it? It was the ſuffering of all theſe things that I have named unto you, and I have but even named them unto you.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, And yet further, the wonder of Chriſts humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation (my ſcope is now to preſent as briefly as may bee, as much of Chriſt as I can unto you, that you may have ſome help for your more clear apprehenſions of Chriſt, and how to make him the object of your faith) The wonder of Chriſt appears in this, that there ſhould bee ſuch a way to ſave men as this is, that the Son of God ſhould bee thus humbled, and this wee finde clearly in Scripture ſet out to us; but that God would have ſuch a way to ſave ſinners, and no other, this is as great a wonder as any thing, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the aſtoniſhment of the Angels, and the admiration of the Saints to all eternity; that the Lord ſhould look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on baſe man, and that hee ſhould have thoughts to ſave him, that was nothing; but when God ſaw that if hee bee ſaved, hee muſt bee ſaved after this way, that God ſhould as it were trouble heaven and earth for the ſaving of a poor wretched ſinful creature, and though God ſaw that it would coſt him ſo dear to ſave a ſoul, yet that hee ſhould go on with his work to ſave him, here is the wonder; but this is the way of ſalvation, and this is that that is infinitely above reaſon, not onely above ſenſe, but above reaſon; which of the Heathens could have imagined that there ſhould have been ſuch a way to ſave man by as this; Why how wilt thou bee ſaved? I will cry to God for mercy, and break off my ſin, and bee ſorry with all my heart, why if this were the way there was no wonder in that; but know oh thou ſinner, whoſoever thou art, that if ever thou bee ſaved, that thou muſt bee ſaved by a wonderful way; and the truth is, conſidering that this is the way of ſaving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, wee may ſtand and wonder that any are ſaved; when you hear of but few that go to heaven, and that moſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:168883:74"/> people in the world periſh, and when you come to hear the way of ſaving man, and what it coſt, and the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of it, you may then ſtand and wonder that any ſhould bee ſaved: Oh when ever you think of ſalvation, think wiſely of this, it is a wonderful work of God to ſave a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the moſt wonderful work that ever God did do; why, becauſe the way of ſaving a ſinner is ſo ſtrange; and truly my Brethren, then doth God begin to work ſavingly upon the heart of a ſinner, when the ſinner begins to ſtand and wonder at the way of ſaving, and till that time it cannot bee conceived that God is beginning ſavingly to work upon your hearts. I appeal to your conſciences, you that have gone on in a ſecure dead-hearted way, when was ever your hearts taken up in admiring at the way of Gods ſaving ſinners? why, if it hath done ſo, that is a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God is beginning to ſhew himſelf unto you in a ſaving way. But now if you go on, and have but low thoughts about the way of ſalvation, if your hearts do not ſanctifie Gods Name in admiring at the wonderful way of ſalvation, know, that yet the Goſpel is hidden to you, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you yet do not underſtand the counſels of God about the way of ſalvation, when your hearts are not taken up with admiring at the glory of God in it.</p>

                        <hi>Chriſt Wonderful in his Conqueſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now it follows further, that Chriſt likewiſe is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in his Conqueſt, hee is the moſt glorious and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Conquerour that ever was in the world.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, What did hee conquer? What doth hee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over? What? hee hath conquered even Divine Juſtice it ſelf, as I may ſo ſpeak; the Law, Gods wrath and juſtice came even fighting as it were againſt Jeſus Chriſt, and Chriſt encounters with them, yea hee encounters with the Devil, and with Hell, and with Death; all theſe are enemies that Jeſus Chriſt encounters withall. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had any one but ſeen Chriſt go into the Liſts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with theſe Combatants, hee could not but have ſtood amazed at it, Oh what will become of this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion that is entred into ſuch a combate as this is! But ſtay but a little, and you ſhall ſee him <hi>leading Captivity captive,</hi> you ſhall ſee him <hi>Triumphing over all,</hi> you ſhall ſee him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and ſaying, <hi>I have the Keyes of Hell, I that was dead, am riſen, and have the Keyes of Hell and Death,</hi> you ſhall ſee him Triumphing over Wrath and Juſtice, and the Law, and the Devils, you ſhall ſee him fetching all that hee came for out of the hand of the Devil, yea here is the wonder of the Conqueſt, never was there a man that did conquer death but onely Jeſus Chriſt that had power over
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:168883:77"/> Death: All other Conquerors they may conquer men, and kill them, but they cannot conquer Death it ſelf; now Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts Conqueſt was over Death its ſelf, to have the very keyes of Death, and that follows, <hi>Death and Hell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And further, which makes the wonder of his Conqueſt, hee doth conquer death by dying, that is the wonder of it. What man conquers his enemy by being ſlain himſelf? Jeſus Chriſt did ſo, hee conquers all his enemies that came againſt him, hee conquers them by dying, and therefore in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. it is ſpoken of Chriſts coming to dye upon the Croſs: <hi>And having ſpoyled Principalities and Powers, hee made a ſhew of them openly, Triumphing over them in it.</hi> When Chriſt was brought upon the Croſs, one would think hee had been triumphed over himſelf then, for hee was brought very low indeed when hee was brought there to hang be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two <hi>Malefactors,</hi> as if he had been the greateſt <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi> of all; now one would have thought that Devils and wicked men, and Death, and all had triumphed over him; but mark, the Text ſaith, <hi>That he did there ſpoyl Principalities and Powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, Triumphing over them in it.</hi> Wee can imagine ſomewhat of Chriſts Triumph now in heaven ſitting at the right hand of the Father, when hee aſcended into heaven, there hee Triumphed; but to imagine a triumph of Chriſt in his Croſs, when his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were ſcorning and contemning him, that then hee ſhould ſpoyl Principalities and Powers, and upon the Croſs Triumph over them, this is a <hi>great myſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and herein is the wonder of Chriſts Conqueſt, of Chriſts Triumph.</p>
                     <p>And then further, the wonder of the Triumph of Chriſt conſiſts in this, That hee hath not onely vanquiſhed all the enemies of his people, but hee hath vanquiſhed them by <hi>his own power:</hi> Conquerours have uſe of the ſtrength of others, but Chriſt had ſtrength enough of his own without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and hee did not onely quell the Adverſary, but hee turns all into good to his people: It is one thing for a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:168883:78"/> Conquerour to overcome an enemy, ſo as an enemy ſhall not bee able to do any more hurt to thoſe that belong to him, and another thing to ſubdue them ſo far as to make them all to bee ſervants to him, that is a greater Conqueſt. Man by a ſtrong Army may bee a Conquerour by killing his enemies, and ſo never to hear of them more, but if hee can ſubdue and bring them all to bee uſeful and ſerviceable to himſelf and his people, this Conqueſt is a great deal the more glorious; now ſuch is the Conqueſt of Chriſt, that hee hath not onely quelled their power, but hath brought all to bee ſerviceable to his people, the <hi>Law</hi> is ſerviceable to them, and now <hi>Gods Juſtice</hi> is for good to them, and the very <hi>wrath</hi> of God is now for their good, and the Devil, and Death, and Hell, and wicked men, they are all made uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo unto his people.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Chriſt is wonderful in his Conqueſt in this, that hee conquered likewiſe as a common Perſon, as a head, and in him hee hath made all his Saints Conquerours, yea the Scripture ſaith that they are <hi>more than Conquerours</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt, in him they are looked upon as having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all thoſe: Thou that art the weakeſt in thy ſelf, and art able to do leaſt, art afraid of every expreſſion of Gods wrath, and terrour of the Law, of the threats of wicked men, of the temptations of the Devil, of the very thoughts of Death or Hell, yet I ſay, if thou beeſt a beleever, thou haſt conquered all theſe already, they are not one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now more particularly there is following the Conqueſt of Chriſt, Chriſts Reſurrection, and his Aſcention, and his ſitting at the right hand of the Father, and his coming to Judgement: In all theſe wee have a wonderful Redeemer.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168883:78"/> I very briefly preſent all theſe before you, but in a few words to ſhew you a little of the myſtery of godlineſs in every one of theſe, that ſo I might in a very little narrow compaſs, preſent the chief glory of Jeſus Chriſt unto you, I mean the heads of it; though wee cannot tell you the thouſandth thouſandth part of the glory of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>Chriſt was wonderful in his Reſurrection; there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a Reſurrection, nor never ſhall bee, as Chriſts was. That Chriſt roſe from the dead, I ſuppoſe you all know, but now the myſtery of godlineſs in this, and the wonderful work of God in it, In <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. it is ſaid, That Chriſt was mightily declared to bee the Son of God in his Reſurrection from the dead.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay, Why, others riſe too, both godly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall riſe, how is Chriſt wonderfully and mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to bee the Son of God by the Reſurrection from the dead?</p>
                     <p>Why thus, Chriſt hee undertaking to ſatisfie for mans ſins, to pay the debt that man did owe to God for his Sin; God the Father comes upon him, ſues out the Bond, caſts him into Priſon, into the Gaol: Now when Jeſus Chriſt did ariſe from the dead, there was a declaration to all the world that hee had ſatisfied the debt fully to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hee had paid fully what Divine Juſtice did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for the ſin of man; now this was a mighty declaration of Jeſus Chriſt to bee the Son of God; had hee not been the Son of God, hee could never have roſe again, having dyed upon ſuch tearms as hee did; Chriſt did dye to ſatisfie Gods wrath, and undertook this, Lord I am content to come under the bonds of death till thine infinite Juſtice ſhall ſay, That it is ſatisfied, that it hath enough: If all the Angels in heaven, and men on the earth had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took ſuch a work, and ſaid, Lord, Let us all dye, and abide under the power of Death, until thine infinite Juſtice ſhall
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168883:79"/> ſay, It is enough, they muſt have abode to all eternity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, they could never have come out of Priſon, but have lain there; but now Chriſt hee undertook this work, and was content to bee under the power of Death till God ſhould fully diſcharge him, as being ſatisfied; God ſaith at length I am ſatisfied, Let the priſon doors bee opened, let him go; ſo that when Chriſt comes out of the Grave, now hee is declared before men and Angels mightily in a wonderful manner to bee the Son of God; and it is upon this that the Scripture ſaith in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> which is applied by the Apoſtle in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. and ſome other Scriptures unto Chriſts Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>This is now, as if ſo bee that Chriſt had been begotten but that day; why Chriſt was the begotten Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>I but Chriſt coming under the charge of mans ſin, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of death, all the while he was in that low eſtate of humiliation, hee doth not appear like the Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, but when hee comes and gets the power over all, and is acquitted and riſes again, now hee doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like himſelf indeed, <hi>the onely begotten Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> hee is now mightily declared to bee the Son of God; and in this the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt was wonderful, for the wonderful power and efficacy that there is in it; Chriſt being acquitted, all the elect were in him acquitted, all were acquitted in him vertually, though there is another acquitting perſonally when they beleeve: At the very time of Chriſts Reſurrection, all the Elect were acquitted as in a head, yet I ſay, There is another acquitting from God in ones own perſon, that is upon beleeving: From hence that notable Scripture wee have in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>The like figure whereunto, even Baptiſm doth now ſave us (not the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>There is abundance in every one of theſe, but it is not my purpoſe to handle the Reſurrection of Chriſt, or his Aſſention, but meerly to give you a little glimpſe of the myſtery of godlineſs that there is therein, that you may underſtand him aright, ſo as you may bee able to exerciſe your faith upon him, not onely Dying and Humbled, but Conquering and Riſing.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And for the Aſcention of Chriſt into heaven the manner of it was wonderful. There comes a cloud and carries him up, and the Diſciples ſtands gazing; it was a wonder to bee gazed at, the Aſcention of Jeſus Chriſt, body and ſoul into heaven, in that glorious way.</p>
                     <p>But eſpecially if wee conſider that Chriſt aſcended like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as our head, aſcended into heaven as the High Prieſt went into the Holy of Holies: And it is ſaid, that wee are <hi>ſet together in heavenly places together with Chriſt,</hi> ſo you have it in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hriſt Jeſus:</hi> For Chriſt went as in our names to take poſſeſſion of heaven, this is the myſtery of godlineſs in Chriſts Aſcention: Hee went up to Heaven, but hee went in the name of the Elect to take poſſeſſion, as a man that hath bought houſe and lands, may have one appointed by him to go in his name to take poſſeſſion of the houſe and land, Jeſus Chriſt in the name of all the elect from the beginning of the world to the end, went
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:168883:81"/> up unto heaven to take poſſeſſion there, and on purpoſe to prepare Manſions for them againſt their coming: Thus wonderful was Chriſt in his Aſcention.</p>

                        <hi>Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of the Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in heaven Chriſt ſits at <hi>the right hand of the Father,</hi> thereby declaring that God the Father was well-pleaſed with all that hee hath done, becauſe hee ſets him at his <hi>right hand;</hi> after Chriſt had made an end of all his work, hee is ſaid to ſit down, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. <hi>This man after hee had offered one ſacrifice for ſins for ever, ſate down on the right hand of God;</hi> hee had done his work, and God the Father approves of him, and ſo honors him in ſetting him at his right hand, and there gives unto him all power to rule together with himſelf, as you heard in his Kingly Office, and there hee is to make <hi>Interceſſion</hi> continually for his Elect, and hath that weight of glory put upon him that is poſſible for humane nature to have put upon him, that is the meaning of ſitting at the right hand of God; theſe four things are meant by it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When hee came to heaven, God the Father, that hee might acknowledge that his Son had fully done the work that hee was ſent into the world about, hee doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him by ſetting him at his right hand.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hee gives unto him all Authority and Power to Reign together with himſelf.<note place="margin">Matth. 28.18.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>And then fourthly, It is to ſignifie that Chriſt hath the higheſt degree of glory, that it is poſſible for humane nature to bee capable of; Therefore you muſt not underſtand the right hand of God in a corporeal way, as if God had right hand or left, but ſitting ſo in thoſe four reſpects as I have named: And all theſe make Chriſt a wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168883:81"/> hee that ſhall come up to God the Father in Heaven, and to have God own his being fully pleaſed with what hee did upon the Earth, and there ſetting him upon his own Throne, to reign with him, and there to bee for ever to make interceſſion for the Saints, and to have the height of all glory to bee beſtowed upon him; Certainly this is a wonderful Redeemer.</p>

                        <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty, who would not fear thee, O thou King of Saints!</hi> The great things that Chriſt doth in the world towards his Churches, are wonderful, and the great eſteem his Saints have of him, they account all things as dung and droſs for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And hee ſhall bee wonderful eternally hereafter in the higheſt Heavens, and there hee will bee the matter of the wonder of all the Angels and Saints; and the matter of the admiration, and the praiſes that God ſhall have to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, it ſhall bee from what the Angels and Saints do ſee in Jeſus Chriſt; therefore ſurely hee will bee wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>And then wonderful, when the underſtandings of the Saints ſhall bee elevated to the higheſt pitch that they are capable of: ſometimes wee do wonder at things, becauſe of our ignorance; ignorant people will wonder almoſt at any thing; at the works of Arts and Sciences, they wonder, becauſe they know but little, but now that, that the moſt underſtanding man in the world ſhall wonder at, certainly it hath ſome great excellency in it: Now Chriſt ſhall not bee the wonder of the Saints onely while they are here in in this world, but when they ſhall bee in Heaven, and have their underſtandings enlightened and enlarged to the height that poſſibly they can bee enlarged to, and yet even then Chriſt ſhall bee their wonder, and they ſhall wonder at Chriſt more than they do now abundantly: Certainly that hath real excellency in it indeed, and great excellency, that the more underſtanding a man is, the more hee ſhall admire at it: perhaps poor people they may wonder at ſome men for their parts, yet if they had any great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding themſelves, they would ſee ſuch a mans parts had little in them; but if a man had ſuch parts, that the more
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:168883:82"/> any man came to underſtand him, the higher in degree their underſtandings were, the more they ſhould wonder, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this man had a great deal of excellency in him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: So it is in Chriſt, that when the Saints ſhall bee ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the height, they ſhall ſo much the more admire at him.</p>
                     <p>Further, In Heaven Chriſt ſhall bee wondred at for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; many things are wondred at for the preſent, I but the wonder quickly ceaſes; wee uſe to ſay of ſtrange things, they are but of nine daies wonder, but Jeſus Chriſt is not onely a wonder at firſt, when the ſoul comes firſt to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Jeſus Chriſt: It is true, poor ſinners at their firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Jeſus Chriſt, for the very novelty of thoſe things they ſee in him, they do admire at them, they never did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch things before; but the truth is, if that grace bee true, thou ſhalt not onely wonder when thou comeſt to Chriſt at firſt, at the excellency in him, but the longer thou continueſt a Beleever, the more thou wilt wonder; and when thou comeſt to Heaven, after thouſand millions of millions of years, thou wilt wonder as much at him as thou didſt the firſt moment; thoſe men that have made profeſſion of Religion, and ſeem'd to come to Chriſt, they wonder at firſt hearing of the Goſpel, like the <hi>ſtony-ground,</hi> that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word with joy,</hi> Oh how wonderfully are they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the firſt hearing of the glorious things of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel! but now mark, their wonder quickly ceaſes, and their joy ceaſes within a little while; they do not now ſee ſo great excellency to admire at it, neither have they ſo great joy; but where there is true Faith, there the ſoul doth not onely wonder at Chriſt, at his firſt comming to Chriſt, but ſtill more and more to all eternity.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Certainly Jeſus Chriſt is little known in the world, if this bee hee, this great wonder of the world: Oh how little is Chriſt known! Chriſt is but a meer Notion and Imagination to moſt people in the world; you heard the very ſound of this name, and how Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners; but I appeal unto your conſciences, when were your hearts taken with the admiration of the glory of God ſhining in the face of Jeſus Chriſt? hath Chriſt been made the greateſt wonder in the world unto you? ſome of you have ſeen many wondrous works of God, ſome of you perhaps in the Seas, or abroad in other Countries, or if not there, yet you have ſeen the Heavens, and the Earth, at which you many times wonder; but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168883:84"/> when did God dart light into your ſpirits, to cauſe you to ſee ſo much of Jeſus Chriſt, as made him to bee the great wonder of all his works? certainly that ſoul knows not God nor Chriſt ſavingly, that knows him not as the wonder of the world; it is impoſſible that ſuch a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as man is ſhould come to underſtand ſuch great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of godlineſs as are in Chriſt in any meaſure, but muſt needs admire at the glory of that great work, and ſay with acclamation, Oh the height, and depth, and breadth, and length of the glory of God, his Wiſdome, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Truth, and Power!</p>
                     <p>Many Notes of Trial there may bee of Faith, but I know not any one more familiar than this is (at leaſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, it muſt needs bee a true Note) that is, that there cannot bee Faith without it, namely, if the heart hath not been taken up with the wonder of Chriſt, ſo as all the wonders in the world have been darkened in the ſoul in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If Chriſt bee ſo great a wonder, then O how vile a thing is it for the hearts of men to prefer any baſe filthy luſts before Jeſus Chriſt? when God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted him in that wonderful way unto the children of men, and ſo much of his glory in him, yet that their hearts ſhould bee taken off from him, and every baſe luſt to bee prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him, Oh how juſt muſt the condemnation of ſuch bee for ever! wee may take up that complaint that there was in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.7.<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.7.</note> 
                        <hi>Our Fathers underſtood not thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: So the truth is, as our Fathers did not, ſo few there are that underſtand the wonders of the Lord in Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore every thing is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before him; with what infinite indignation muſt God needs look upon that wretched ſoul, that ſhall prefer every baſe luſt before Jeſus Chriſt? I remember a ſpeech of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> ſpeaking of that Text, <hi>That our vile bodies ſhall bee made like unto the glorious body of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith hee, were all the world turned into tears, yet they were not ſufficient to lament the miſery of that ſoul that forſakes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:168883:85"/> Jeſus Chriſt: his heart was ſo much taken with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Jeſus Chriſt, that hee thought it impoſſible to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the miſery of the creature that ſhould forſake him: and ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> having his heart filled with the glorious Myſtery of Chriſt, hee breaks forth with this dreadful curſe, <hi>Hee that loveth not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him bee Anathema Maran-atha,</hi> as if St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay (having his ſpirit filled with the glory of Chriſt) Oh what ſhall God manifeſt ſo much of his glory in his Son, and ſhall baſe wretched vile creatures prefer their luſts before him, and have their hearts taken up with other vain things, and not love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? let that ſoul bee curſed with a bitter curſe, ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> ſuch a ſoul doth deſerve indeed to bee curſed with a bitter and an eternal curſe, that ſhall hear ſo much of Jeſus Chriſt, and how God hath revealed himſelf in that wonderful way in his Son, and yet that ſoul ſhall not bee willing to forſake a baſe luſt for all the good there is in Jeſus Chriſt; let that ſoul bee curſed with a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter curſe: It deſerves above all creatures to have the moſt bitter curſe to bee upon it to all eternity: certainly the more glory there is in Chriſt, the more dreadful will the condemnation of wicked men bee, <hi>This is (the) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> that ſuch glorious <hi>light is come into the world, and men choſe darkneſs rather than light.</hi> How many hear of Chriſt, and minde little, but onely have a noiſe, they hear ſome ſtrange things of Chriſt, and let them paſs by, and think there is little reallity in what they hear, but the onely real comfort is in ſatisfying of the fleſh in the luſts of it. In <hi>Act.</hi> 13.41.<note place="margin">Act. 13.41.</note> wee have an excellent Scripture for the reproof of ſuch that hear the Goſpel, and minde it not; Beware therefore, leſt that come upon you which is ſpoken of in the Prophets, <hi>Behold yee deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh, for I work a work in your daies, a work which yee ſhall in no wiſe beleeve, though a man declare it unto you:</hi> It is ſpoken concerning Chriſt, as appears in the verſe before, <hi>And by him all that beleeve are juſtified from all things, by which yee could not bee juſtified by the Law of Moſes:</hi> Now
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:168883:85"/> then it follows, Beware therefore leſt that come upon you, which is ſpoken of in the Prophets, Behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh; as if hee ſhould ſay, you hear the Goſpel about the glorious way that God hath to reconcile ſinners to himſelf, to juſtifie ſinners, but in the mean time your hearts do cloſe with your own Conceits, and your own waies, with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and think by your own good meanings, and your own good works, that you ſhall do well enough, and ſhall ſtand before God; but ſaith the Apoſtle, Beware leſt that come upon you which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Prophets, Behold yee deſpiſers, and wonder: you perhaps, when you hear ſuch things declared unto you, you account it ſtrange doctrine, and you ſtand and wonder what the meaning of thoſe things ſhould bee; but as you wonder, ſo you do deſpiſe; you condemn it as a ſtrange thing that you were not wont to hear heretofore, and as a thing you cannot underſtand the reaſon of; this is the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al guize of carnal hearts, when they hear any doctrine, though there bee never ſo much of God in it, and of the Myſtery of the Goſpel that is revealed in it, yet if they underſtand not the reaſon of it, if it appear to them as a new thing, they wonder indeed, but they deſpiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and condemn it, and ſlight it, and paſs it over, as they did St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, <hi>What will this babler ſay?</hi> hee brings us news of a ſtrange God, and the like: ſo theſe are things that people are not acquainted withall, and ſo they caſt them off, and deſpiſe: but mark, ſaith the Text, Take heed, beware leſt this come upon you, that you ſhall behold and wonder, and deſpiſe and periſh too, for I work a work in your daies, a work which you ſhall in no wiſe beleeve, though a man declare it unto you: there ſhall bee the great Counſels of God revealed in your daies, and in your Congregations, there ſhall bee revealed thoſe Counſels of God, whereby God intends to ſave many ſouls; and here and there God will make known theſe things to ſave poor ſouls, but you in the mean time being conceited of your own underſtandings, or your own Civil Righteouſneſs,

                     <p>Thirdly, But further, in the third place; If Jeſus Chriſt bee ſo great a wonder, certainly then the miſery of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is very great, it follows from hence; if there bee ſuch need of ſo wonderful a Redeemer, Oh the dreadful breach that ſin hath made between God and man, that required ſuch a wonderful work of God to make it up! this is that that God would have you have a right underſtanding of, and have ſerious thoughts about it; God would not have ſinful wretched man to think the breach between God and him is a light matter, a little thing: No, when the Lord hath ſent his Son into the world, and hath declared him to bee thus wonderful: when the Lord ſhews what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful glorious work of his there is in his Son for the ſaving of mankind, hee thereby doth declare unto you, and would have you know it, that the breach that your ſin hath made between God and your own ſouls, it is a wonderful
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:168883:86"/> breach; certainly were the Miſery of man no other but ſuch as the power of Angels, as the power of any meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could help out of, Jeſus Chriſt had never come into the world, there had never been ſuch a wonderful work of God to redeem man; But now when you hear that the way of God to redeem man is ſo wonderful, you have cauſe to lay your hands upon your hearts, and ſay, Oh the depth of miſery that my ſoul is fallen into! Oh the deſperate diſeaſe of my ſoul, that muſt have ſuch a wonderful cure! Oh that ever the great and infinite God ſhould work ſo wonderfully for the ſalvation of ſuch a poor wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſinful man is! My Brethren, wee do not ſanctifie the Name of God in the great thing that God would bee ſanctified in, except wee have right apprehenſions of the dreadful breach our ſin hath made between the Lord and our own ſouls, that ſo wee might have right apprehenſions of this wonderful work that God hath done for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man-kind; this is the reaſon why God ſo many times doth bring ſinful creatures into ſo great ſtraights, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very gulf of deſpair oftentimes before hee reveals the ſaving knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt unto them: It is, I ſay, becauſe the Lord would have his name ſanctified in this wonderful work of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner might bee prepared to ſtand and admire at the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt; And there is nothing in the world that God looks ſo much for as this, to be ſanctified in theſe wonderful things that hee hath done for man-kind in Chriſt; and if wee have but ſlight thoughts of the breach that our ſin hath made, certainly wee cannot but have ſlight thoughts likewiſe of the work that God hath done to deliver us from our ſin: Thou thinkeſt thy ſin to bee a light matter, but know, that when thou haſt ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, there muſt bee the moſt wonderful work of God to reconcile thee to himſelf, that ever God did from all eternity, or will do to all eternity; this is the greateſt wonder, his ſending of Jeſus Chriſt into the world; know therefore the depth of thy miſery by this; if God ſhould
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:168883:87"/> have deviſed as it were from all eternity how to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted the wonderful miſery of man-kind, no greater could bee found than this wonderful work of his in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of man-kind. This is a third.</p>
                     <p>And then Fourthly, Is Jeſus Chriſt the great wonder of the world? hence then all Beleevers have exceeding cauſe of rejoycing in the hearing of what Chriſt is, what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Saviour they have, <hi>Let the children of Zion rejoyce in their King:</hi> Rejoyce in this,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That God hath ſo honoured you, as that hee hath wrought ſo wonderfully for your ſalvation; certainly, as thy redemption is, ſo art thou; that is, there is ſome reflection of the glory of thy Redeemer upon thee; how hath Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God looks upon all the Kings of the Earth as worms, <hi>Yea all the Nations of the earth as the drop of the bucket, and the duſt of the ballance, as nothing, leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> You ſee how meanly God values all the Nations of the Earth: But when hee ſpeaks of his Son, that is thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, <hi>His Name ſhall bee called wonderful,</hi> ſaith hee, hee is wonderful in the eyes of God the Father; thou that haſt ſuch a wonderful Redeemer as this is, certainly thy condition muſt needs bee comfortable.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, The main comfort that Beleevers may have from this glory of Chriſt, as hath been opened to you, is this, that hereby they may ſee Jeſus Chriſt as a full ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for their ſouls to reſt upon, whatever their condition bee; thou haſt an All-ſufficient Saviour, thou haſt an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that thou mayeſt venture thy ſoul, thy eternal eſtate upon, for hee is a wonderful Redeemer; conceive thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to the uttermoſt that poſſibly can bee, ſuppoſe thou ſeeſt the guilt of all thy ſins before thee, and apprehendeſt thy ſoul bound over to eternal death for thy ſin; ſuppoſe thou ſeeſt the juſtice of God coming out againſt thee, to require ſatisfaction for thy ſin; the curſe of the Law, that likewiſe
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:168883:87"/> brings thee under it, and thou ſeeſt the bottomeleſs pit even ready open for thee, and the horrible vile iniquities that thou haſt been guilty of, preſenting themſelves unto thee with all the aggravations of them; ſuppoſe all this, And thou ſtandeſt now before the great God, ready to receive the ſentence of thy eternal eſtate. Now theſe things may make thy heart to ſhake, and indeed they will where they are ſeen really; But in the midſt of ſuch a ſight, if God do but give thee a ſight of thy Redeemer that is ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, here is enough to draw forth Faith, yea to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Faith in the ſoul; let this bee but preſented, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy miſery bee, yet know, here is a wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who cannot onely cure ordinary diſeaſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver in ordinary troubles, but can wonderfully deliver, and no cure can bee too hard for him; Oh therefore thou troubled ſoul! that doſt apprehend the evil of thy ſin, and the dread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>l danger that thou art in: Oh that thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt but ſee this wonderful Redeemer before thee! thou wouldeſt ſee him to bee an object for the moſt vile wretchedeſt ſinner that ever lived upon the face of the earth to reſt upon; And becauſe God the Father accounts wonderfully of his Son; therefore it is that hee would not have us onely to beleeve in his Son in ordinary caſes, but in extraordinary caſes; you that are beleevers, and hope you have any part in Chriſt, know, that God expects that you ſhould ſanctifie his Son as a wonderful Redeemer; now, if you can onely beleeve in Chriſt in an ordinary way, when your condition is ordinary, and your ſtraights not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, this is not to ſanctifie Chriſt as a <hi>wonderful Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> Now let this bee but laid to thy heart when temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are ſtrong, and when thy heart is ready to ſink in any extremity; It may bee temptation comes and tells thee thy condition is extraordinary, who was ever ſo left of God as thou art, then do but lay theſe truths upon thy heart, that have been revealed in the opening of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfulneſs of Chriſt, and even ſay thus to thy ſoul, well, but oh my ſoul! thou haſt heretofore beleeved in God,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168883:88"/> but haſt thou ſanctified the Name of Chriſt, as <hi>wonderful?</hi> haſt thou beleeved in Jeſus Chriſt, as in him whoſe Name by God himſelf is called <hi>wonderful?</hi> Thou haſt, thou thinkeſt, beleeved in him as a Saviour, as a Redeemer, but haſt thou beleeved in him as thus wonderful in his Natures, in his Perſon, in his Offices, in his indowments, and in all the great things that hee hath done, in the glory of the Father that ſhines in him? haſt thou ſanctified his Name in all thoſe particulars wherein Chriſt hath been made known to bee wonderful? certainly Beleevers do not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie this Name of Chriſt, except there bee ſome kinde of proportion between their Faith, and all theſe glorious things that are revealed of Jeſus Chriſt: It is hee that is a full object for thy ſoul to reſt upon in all ſtraights whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when the men of the world ſhall bee at their <hi>wits end,</hi> they having their ordinary help fail them, yet thou that art a Beleever, and knoweſt what Jeſus Chriſt is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Thirdly, The conſolation to Beleevers from this title of Chriſt, is in this; That certainly, if there bee ſuch a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Redeemer, that God himſelf doth glory ſo much in, and account him ſo <hi>wonderful,</hi> then it muſt needs follow, that God doth intend <hi>wonderful</hi> things for the Saints; no wiſe man that hath abilities, will in a wonderful manner buſie himſelf about a trifle: certainly if the Lord doth thus work for man-kind in his Son, if the Lord provide ſuch a <hi>wonderful</hi> Saviour for the children of men, wee may fully conclude, that God hath wonderful thoughts to do great things for man-kind; the thoughts of God for the good of man-kind are very great, and very glorious, they are ſome high things, ſome glorious things that God doth aim at for man-kind. Oh raiſe up therefore your thoughts! let all that are but men raiſe up their thoughts, and think, ſurely there is ſome great happineſs for the children of men; God hath revealed it from Heaven, when hee hath told us that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168883:88"/> there is ſuch a <hi>wonderful</hi> Redeemer come into the Earth: But Oh you Beleevers! do you in a ſpecial manner raiſe up your hearts, and expect glorious things? and though you have but little from God for the preſent, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God hath wonderful thoughts about you that are the members of Jeſus Chriſt; and there muſt come a time, that there muſt bee wonderful things beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, or otherwiſe God ſhould loſe the honour of all the wonderful things hee hath done in Chriſt, and that hee will never do: God will at length bring every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever to ſuch a height of glory, as before Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels it ſhall bee declared by the glory of your ſouls, that Jeſus Chriſt was a wonderful Redeemer; ſuch glory thou mayeſt have, wee cannot tell the particulars; If wee ſhould go to open the happineſs of the Saints, what it ſhould bee in Heaven, wee ſhould quickly bee ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up; but one would think that this one thing ſhould bee enough to fill the heart of the Beleever with joy, I ſhall have ſo much happineſs from God one day, as muſt declare before Men and Angels, that Jeſus Chriſt was a <hi>wonderful</hi> Saviour, ſuch glory as God himſelf will glory in.</p>
                     <p>Oh look here! look upon this poor wretch, that a while was ſuch a vile wicked creature, and a childe of wrath, and of perdition in its ſelf, and look now what a height of glory this ſoul is raiſed up to, and now give your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whether my Son bee not a wonderful Redeemer; this will bee the condition of every poor beleever that lives, and comfort your ſelves in exerciſing your Faith in this.</p>
                     <p>What ever I am now for the preſent, though but a lump of clay and filth, yet I being a Beleever, Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mine, my condition muſt bee ſuch one day as God the Father wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Oh what a ſhame is it that thoſe that do profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, ſhould underſtand ſo little of Jeſus Chriſt! this is that that God expects: I ſay, that wee ſhould ſtudy the Goſpel, ſearch into the Goſpel, that wee may ſee more of Chriſt; the more wee ſee, the more ſtill wee ſhall wonder, for Chriſt is an infinite depth, and the more wee ſearch into him, the more wee ſhall ſee cauſe to wonder: In the firſt of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> mark what a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Paul</hi> makes for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in the 17, and 18. <hi>verſes,</hi> hee told them before, that hee did not ceaſe to give thanks for <hi>them, making mention of them in his prayers: to what end? That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdome and Revelation in the knowledge of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee doth not onely pray, that they might have ſome knowledge of him, but that they might have a Spirit of Wiſdome and Revelation in the knowledge of Chriſt; and this from the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and from the Father of Glory.</p>

                     <p>And as wee ſhould ſtudy Chriſt, and praiſe and bleſs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:168883:92"/> God, and have our hearts enlarged for Jeſus Chriſt: So this is the duty of beleevers, to whom God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt as <hi>wonderful,</hi> that in their converſations they ſhould hold out the wonderful Glory of Jeſus Chriſt; thou ſhouldeſt ſo walk before men, as to manifeſt to all the world that thy Saviour is a wonderful Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                     <p>And thou ſhouldeſt manifeſt it by thy wonderful change; that ſoul that hath part in Chriſt, whoſe Name is <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,</hi> honours Chriſt in this, If hee doth manifeſt that ſince hee came to know Jeſus Chriſt, there is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change made in him; what a change is there made in this youth, or childe, young-man, or neighbour, or friend! Not long ſince what an ignorant ſot was hee? but ſince hee went to hear the Word, Oh the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in a little time that ſuch a one hath got in the Myſteries of the Goſpel! ſuch a one was not able to go into Gods preſence to expreſſe himſelf in prayer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe but upon a book, but now, Oh what a ſpirit of prayer hath God given to ſuch a poor wretch, that was ſo ignorant the other day! Now, O how can hee pour out his ſoul before the Lord! Such a one that not long ſince was a prophane and looſe liver, and ſenſual and baſe in his life and converſation, now oh how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how heavenly, how ſpiritual, and would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leſt known ſin, if hee might gain a thouſand worlds for it! ſuch a one that was falſe in his ſervice before, now how truſty! one may truſt ones life, and all that one hath with him now; ſuch a one that heretofore was a ſwearer, oh how doth hee reverence the Name of God! ſuch a one that was a froward paſſionate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited man or woman, now how meek and gentle are they! what a mighty change is there in the ſpirit of ſuch a ſervant, or wife, or husband, or neighbour! And ſuch a one that was altogether for himſelf, and proud, and haughty, but now, oh how humble, and ſubmiſſive!
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:168883:92"/> now hee can deny himſelf of any thing: As wee read of Chriſt, that when hee <hi>commanded the winds and the waves,</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>all people wondred at him:</hi> So when the winds of thy paſſion are up, if thou canſt but bid them bee ſtill, all would wonder at it: Oh how comes there ſo great a change! ſuch a one that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient before in any ſuffering, now what ever hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, how like a Lamb is hee, and opens not his mouth! Now in the midſt of afflictions, and pains, and troubles, hee can lye rejoycing and praiſing God; And ſuch a one, though hee hath never ſuch ſtrong temptations to draw him on the other ſide, yet now hee can reſiſt the ſtrongeſt temptations; before, if a companion did but hold up his finger, hee muſt go, but now I ſay hee can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſtrong temptations, and oh how hee accounts it his glory and happineſſe to ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt: Now this doth manifeſt Chriſt a wonderful Saviour. As it was the ſpeech of a Heathen, ſeeing the Chriſtians ſuffer with ſo great patience, hee cries out, <hi>Of a truth, the God of the Chriſtians is a great God, that doth inable them to do ſuch great things:</hi> So thou muſt ſo walk in thy life, that thou muſt manifeſt that Jeſus Chriſt is a wonderful Saviour.</p>
                     <p>And bee aſhamed to complain of any difficulty in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties that thou art ſet about; thou art ſet about ſuch a duty, and oh thou complaineſt they are hard, and difficult, and tedious! Is it for thy Saviour that thou doeſt it? thou ſhouldeſt bee willing to go thorow fire and water; and in this one thing the wonderfulneſs of the change of a ſoul doth appear as much as in any thing, That thoſe things that before were accounted burdens, now the ſoul accounts them as a priviledge, and the joy of its heart; others cannot do ſo: Now the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel makes ſuch a change, and in this change of thy heart, and of thy life, Jeſus Chriſt is held forth in the world to bee a wonderful Saviour; but now, if thou canſt do no
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:168883:93"/> more than thoſe that are ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt, what honour hath Chriſt in thy life and converſation? One paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or two more.</p>
                     <p>If Chriſt bee a <hi>wonderful Saviour,</hi> hence then every one that hears of Chriſt, ſhould think it to bee a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to miſſe of Jeſus Chriſt: Oh then let all ſouls to whom Chriſt is made known, make after him! Oh thou wretched ſoul, that haſt not yet underſtood the way of God towards man-kind, now labour to know it! If the Lord hath wonderful thoughts for the ſaving of man-kind, then let thy thoughts bee ſuch: And after all this ſhall my ſoul periſh eternally? ſhall I bee caſt away, notwithſtanding God hath wrought in ſuch a glorious and wonderful way for the ſalvation of ſouls? muſt I periſh at laſt for all this? Thy heart ſhould make towards God, and bee incouraged in this, becauſe the way of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo wonderful: why, may not thy ſoul come in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and bee ſaved? there is not the worſt of you all, but here is help in this <hi>wonderful</hi> Saviour to help you, and redeem you; had you but hearts now to come in and to fall down before the Lord when you get alone in your cloſets, and ſay, Lord, I have heard that there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Saviour come into the world, and hath done wonderfully for the redeeming of man-kind; Oh that hee might bee <hi>wonderful</hi> in my ſalvation alſo! that I may bee among the number of thoſe that may to all eternity bee admiring at thy glory in Jeſus Chriſt; many of you rejoyce in this, that God hath wrought wonderfully to preſerve you ſome times out of dangers, I but what are all the <hi>wonderful works</hi> of God towards you, except you have your part in him whoſe <hi>Name</hi> is called <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And laſt of all, Let us long for that time when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear in all his glory; hee doth appear now to the ſouls of his Saints very wonderful, as hee is ſet out in the Word; but there is a time when Chriſt ſhall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:168883:93"/> come and appear in all his glory in another manner than wee are able to ſet him out: After the <hi>blowing of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet</hi> that you read of in the book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then is the Myſtery finiſhed,</hi> and what is the finiſhing of it? in <hi>chap.</hi> 11. then is the voice heard, ſaying,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.15.</note> 
                        <hi>The Kingdomes of this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and hee ſhall reign for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> Then ſhall the Lord Jeſus Chriſt come and appear in all <hi>his wonderful works</hi> to the children of men, and to <hi>bee admired in the Saints;</hi> then ſhall bee fulfilled the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee have in <hi>John</hi> 14.20, 21.

But doſt thou wonder at Jeſus Chriſt <hi>now?</hi> know, Chriſt will come ere long in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner to bee admired at by his Saints in all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Chriſt was wonderful when hee came with ſin, and when hee comes without ſin hee ſhall bee more wonderful; hee ſhall come in all his glory with his holy Angels, to make good all that hee hath promiſed, and to bring with him all that hee hath purchaſed, and then wee <hi>ſhall ſee him as hee is.</hi> — Now wee ſee Jeſus Chriſt <hi>but thorow a glaſs,</hi> and yet our hearts are taken with him; and wee wonder at him now, but oh how ſhall wee wonder when wee come to ſee <hi>him as hee is!</hi> when wee ſhall behold his face in glory; wee ſee now the Lord Chriſt in his Ordinances, but as in a picture; As at the firſt, when there are treaties between one Prince and another about a march, the firſt ſight that they have of one another, it is but by a picture, and if they bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with but ſeeing the picture one of another, much more will they bee delighted and inamoured with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they come to ſee it its ſelf: ſo it is with the Saints, here all that the Saints can ſee of Jeſus Chriſt, that makes them ſo wonder at him, and to account him to bee the <hi>chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> all is but by ſeeing of him by a picture; Jeſus Chriſt is in Heaven, and hee ſends us his picture in his Ordinances; ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Miniſtry of the Word, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt had been evidently ſet forth crucified among them.</hi> Now are your hearts taken with the ſight of Chriſt, when you ſee him as it were in a picture? know, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Nathanael, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the Figg tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt thou? thou ſhalt ſee greater things than theſe.</hi> So thou ſhalt ere long ſee Jeſus Chriſt as hee is; <hi>Wee are now the Sons of God, but it appears not what wee ſhall bee, for when hee ſhall appear, wee ſhall bee like him, for wee ſhall ſee him as hee is.</hi>

                        <hi>If any man will come after mee, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow mee.</hi> Theſe are the tearms, ſaith Chriſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you muſt follow mee, you muſt bee willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your ſelves, and to take up your croſs, to ſuffer hard things if you follow mee. Chriſt would have his Diſciples know the worſt at firſt, and not pleaſe themſelves in a fools Paradiſe, thinking that by following of him they ſhould
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:168883:102"/> get great matters to themſelves in the world; no, ſaith hee, expect no ſuch matter, but deny your ſelves, and take up my croſs. But this may ſeem to bee hard, it may bee our croſs may bee the loſs of all, the loſs of our lives, and muſt wee take up that? yes, ſaith Chriſt, in the verſe before my Text, bee not ſolicitous what your croſs is like to bee, onely bee willing to take it up. And the truth is, the more willing you are to take it up, the better will it bee for you, and you will get nothing by ſeeking to ſhift for your ſelves, <hi>For whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will loſe his life for my ſake ſhall finde it.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> It may bee when you meet with ſufferings in the world, you will think to ſhift this way, or that way, but you will get nothing: If you would ſave your lives by forſaking the truth, it is the onely way to loſe your lives: But if you bee willing to loſe your lives for my truth, you ſhall ſave them; or what if by forſaking mee and my truth, when you meet with ſuffering, you ſhould ſave your lives, and your eſtates, and live brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the world, do you think you are any gainers by this? you are infinitly miſtaken: If you caſt up the account, you will finde that you have gotten nothing all: <hi>For what is a man profited if hee ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> And thus you ſee how the words come in.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words that I have read unto you, are of exceeding ſerious conſideration: And indeed they ſhould bee as Thunder in every mans ears. Some Scripture that a Miniſter may preach on, may concern ſome particular perſon in a Congregation more than others: But here is a Text concerns every one that hath a ſoul, Man and woman, high and low, old and young, What ſhall it profit any one to gain the whole word, and to loſe their own ſoul? — I have read of one that gave counſel to <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that hee would repeat this Text to himſelf, and ſpend one quarter of an hour in the meditation of it, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man if hee gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> and that hee would make the words of this Text to bee the cloze of his prayer continually, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gain the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:168883:102"/> whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> This was wholeſome counſel; and certainly the tight meditation and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Text would bee of admirable uſe to every ſoul. You have in the words theſe two things plainly hinted.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is in every man a ſoul, a spiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, beſides what is viſible and ſenſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſecondly, <hi>That this ſoul of man is more worth than all the world, it hath that excellency, that if a man gains all the world, and loſes that, when hee hath caſt up his account, hee may put his gains in his eye, hee ſhall finde himſelf a miſerable creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee might make more diviſions, or ſubdiviſions of the words, but I will content my ſelf onely with thoſe two things, and ſpeak chiefly to the latter. Now to make way for that, I will ſpeak a little of the former, <hi>What is a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his ſoul? his Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every man hath a ſoul, a rational ſpiritual ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that that is viſible or ſenſible; in <hi>Job</hi> 32.8. <hi>But there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him underſtanding.</hi> There is a ſpirit in man beſides the bodily ſubſtance that you ſee, there is a ſpirit in man, ſuch a ſpirit as is capable of the inſpiration of the Almighty to give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, &amp;c.

And it was ſo:</hi> But when hee comes to man, hee forms man out of the duſt of the earth, that is for his body, and for his ſpirit, hee breathes into his noſtrils the breath of life. I have read of a people that would not bee perſwaded that there was any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween beaſts and them: And truly there is ſomewhat to do to perſwade carnal hearts of any great difference between a beaſt and them in relation to God, or to another life: But certainly there is a ſpirit in man, there is ſomewat beyond
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:168883:103"/> that body of thine that is viſible, which doth infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thee to look to.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, <hi>Wee ſee that there are actions in men that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that which concerns the body at all:</hi> And therefore ſurely there is a ſpirit in man, beſides what the body is; the higheſt actions of men are ſuch as do not concern the body, as thus, The knowledge of the heavens, the knowledge of Angels, of ſpirits, what hath the body to do with ſuch things? the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the myſteries of the Goſpel, and the converſing with them, they are abſtracted notions from all kinde of bodily ſubſtances; the knowledge of God and Chriſt, yea the very knowledge of Mathematical notions, many notions there are in Arts and Sciences that are abſtract from all bodily things; certainly then there is a ſpirit in man beyond that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſubſtance that doth appear common with the brute beaſts.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is a spirit in man beyond this bodily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: for when this bodily ſubſtance is decaying, mouldring away, there are many thoughts in a man about an eternal eſtate,</hi> and more freſh and lively ſometimes when the body is mouldring away, than ever there was before; there are no creatures but Angels and men that take any cognizance of an eternal eſtate, that take any thoughts about what is to come hereafter.

                     <p>Fifthly, and then laſtly, <hi>There is certainly a ſpirit in man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his bodily ſubſtance: for wee know that there are real pains and torments upon a mans ſpirit.</hi> The burdens of conſcience in the reflex act that a mans conſcience hath upon himſelf ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning of him to appear before the great God: Though a mans body be in never ſuch health, and hath all outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations about him, as muſick, good cheer, friends, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, yet there is that horror and torment in his ſpirit, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through the conſciouſneſs of the guilt of ſin, that hee is not able to bear: nay were there not ſomewhat beyond this bodily ſubſtance, certainly this could never bee; verily then there is a ſpirit in man, and hence therefore you ſee that there is ſomewhat doth concern you all beyond your preſent, outward, and bodily condition. Let no man think that hee hath provided well for himſelf, when hee hath provided mony, and houſe, and lands, and good chear, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:168883:104"/> cloaths, and ſuch kinde of things; do not think that thou art happy in that: for theſe are things that concern thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, there is ſtill another ſubſtance in thee that thou art to look after, that takes little notice of ſuch things as theſe are.</p>
                     <p>Neither do you think that you have provided well for your children, when you have provided an eſtate, an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, ſomewhat to leave them, know, that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubſtance in your children, beſides that outward bodily ſubſtance you look upon. Do you ſee a fine feature, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parts, comely countenance, and your children finely cloathed? I but know there is a ſpirit in that childe beſides that bodily ſubſtance that you are to look to: Certainly man is very far fallen from God, that none ſcarce takes notice of his own ſpirit: We do not only naturally live without a God in the world, ſo as to know little of that infinite divine Spirit that is the firſt being of all things; but wee live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of our own ſpirits, of our own ſouls: Truly few men there are that know their own ſouls. As a man by his eye ſees things that are without him, but he doth not ſee his own eye; ſo by the ſoul wee come to underſtand many things without us, but yet how little do wee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of our own ſouls? well might the Pſalmiſt therefore complain, and ſay, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20. <hi>Man that is in honour, and underſtandeth not, is like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> God did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make man at firſt in honour, but now hee is become like the very beaſts, hee doth minde little or nothing more than the very beaſts themſelves, hee bleſſes himſelf if hee hath but content for the body for a while, as if there were nothing elſe concerned him; I appeal unto your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in this thing, whether the uttermoſt ſphere of your thoughts have been any further than meerly within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of bodily content: If you ſhould come to a beaſt, and talk to it about Trades and titles of honour, and Arts and Sciences, and ſuch kind of things, why what is all this to a beaſt? Give a beaſt hay or corn, and ſuch kinde of things that are ſuitable to it, and it mindes that more than it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168883:104"/> doth any high notions that you are able to tell it; and truly thus it is with ſenſual men, even as the Atheiſt who ſaith in his heart, <hi>That there is no God;</hi> ſo a kinde of Atheiſm there is in their hearts to ſay they have no ſouls, that there is no difference between them and the brute-beaſts; hence it is that they ſavour ſpiritual things ſo little. Tell carnal men of the excellency of the Name of God, Tell them of Jeſus Chriſt, how wonderful hee is, of the wonderful myſteries of the Goſpel, and of the things of eternal life, they are dry things to ſuch a one, hee ſavours them not: Tell him of money, and meat, and drink, and ſports, and cloaths, and ſuch kinde of things, they are ſuitable unto him, there is ſome ſavour in them; but for the great things of the Kingdome of God, and of eternal life, there is no ſavour at all in them; and thus far is man fallen from God, and lives for the moſt part, as if ſo bee hee were capable of no higher good, but meerly to eat and drink, and live for a while here like a beaſt: Thus doth the Devil gull and deceive moſt of us: Now my brethren, this is a work that I have undertaken, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns as much the Miniſters of God to ſhew unto you what you are your ſelves, what God hath made you, as to ſhew you what God is, and what Chriſt is, that you may come to underſtand your ſelves; you can never come to know your reference unto God, untill you come to know what God hath made you; this is therefore my ſcope in this Scripture, to ſhew unto you what God hath made you, and that you have ſouls within you, and ſouls of exceeding great worth (I will not ſay infinite, for none is infinite but God himſelf) but more worth than all the world, than all the creatures that God hath made, except the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven: The ſouls of the children of men are moſt excellent creatures; did but a man or woman conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly that they have ſouls in them beyond their bodies, it would raiſe them up a little.</p>
                     <p>But this next Point that is the main and principal, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct </seg>2</label> Did they but know the worth of their ſouls, it could not but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:168883:105"/> raiſe them very high above thoſe poor empty vanities that they have minded all this while: <hi>Therefore there is in man not onely a ſoul, but that that is more worth than all the world, that if it ſhould bee loſt, that man that gained the whole world, would bee a great loſer in his bargain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Know therefore this, that there is not the pooreſt man or woman living, nay not the pooreſt childe that lyes beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a cruſt of bread at your door, but this childe hath a ſoul in it that is more worth than heaven and earth, this poor ragged tattered childe that lyes in rags, I ſay, crying at your threſhold, and begging a peece of bread, it hath a ſoul in it that hath greater excellency than the Sun, Moon, and Stars, than all the Heavens, than the Sea, than the Earth, put all the creatures in the world together, that are under Angels, the ſpirit of this poor childe hath more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in it, than all theſe things, and that is the thing that I am to make out unto you.</p>
                     <p>Why natural life hath more excellency in it than any creature that hath no life. I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of a Flye, becauſe it hath life, that it hath more excellency in it than the Sun its ſelf, becauſe though the Sun bee a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous creature, yet it hath no life in it; life in the meaneſt creature hath a greater excellency than any thing elſe that hath not life.</p>
                     <p>But now the ſoul hath the higheſt natural life that is, and capable of the higheſt happineſs that any creature is capable of, and therefore more excellent than all the world; But that wee ſhall come too in its order.</p>

And in <hi>Zeck.</hi> 12.1. There is likewiſe an expreſſion to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>That God did form the ſpirit of man within him:</hi>
                        <pb n="209" facs="tcp:168883:105"/> God accounts it a ſpecial part of his glory, that hee makes the ſpirits of men; hee is the Father of ſpirits: But now I ſhall not enter into that controverſie of the Generation of the ſoul; thus far theſe Scriptures with others do evidence, that God hath a more ſpecial hand in the producing of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſubſtance, than hee hath in other Creatures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And further, <hi>The ſoul is onely under Gods command:</hi> No Creature can have power over the ſoul of a man, he may force his body, but his ſoul cannot bee forced by men or Angels.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Yea, <hi>And it is under the power of no Creature to inflict evil upon it: Fear not them, ſaith Chriſt, that can kill the body, and can do no more;</hi> there is all they can do,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28. Luk. 12.4, 5</note> they can but kill the body, fear not them, <hi>but fear him, who after hee hath killed the body, hath power to cast the ſoul into Hell, yea, I ſay unto you, fear him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. So that it appears by the Text, that there is no Creature can do hurt to the ſoul; the Devils themſelves they cannot do it; they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound objects before the ſoul, but except the ſoul do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they cannot force it; it is onely God that hath power over the ſoul, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>fear him,</hi> that is, fear God that hath this power; all other creatures, this is all their do, as wee may ſay, they are able to kill the body.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 But further, <hi>The excellency of the ſoul of man, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto God, appears eſpecially in the large extent of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that it hath to receive the Image of God,</hi> and its ability to work according as God doth work himſelf, and to enjoy communion with God, and to receive the communication of thoſe choice excellencies that God hath to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; theſe things ſhew the excellency of the ſoul: the large extent I ſay of the ſoul in the capacity it hath of good (of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine good.)</p>
                     <p>As Firſt, <hi>It is that that is capable to have the Image of God ſtampt upon it;</hi> Whatſoever the body hath, it is but in way of reflection from the ſoul; wee know thoſe Princes that are great and rich Princes, except neceſſity compells them, do not uſe to ſtamp their Image upon Leather, or Braſs, or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:168883:106"/> but upon the choiceſt metals, upon Gold and Silver: So when God would have a Creature upon which hee would ſtamp his Image, hee doth not chuſe a mean Creature, the brute beaſts, or any ſenſitive Creature, but hee chuſeth the moſt excellent of his Creatures, Angels, and the ſpirits of men, that are, one as Gold, and the other as Silver, and the great God ſtamps his Image upon theſe two, and onely upon theſe two; theſe are the two Principal Metals, Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Angels and mens ſpirits, upon which God did ſtamp his Image in their firſt Creation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Not onely to have the Image of God upon them, <hi>but they are able to work as God himſelf works;</hi> No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature is able to do ſo, but Angels and mens ſpirits: And this is the principal thing that ſhews the excellency of the ſoul, it is able to underſtand the firſt beeing, God himſelf, and to make God to bee the laſt end of all things; what is Gods work, wherein the very happineſs, as I may ſo ſay, of God himſelf conſiſts, but in the underſtanding of himſelf, as the firſt beeing, and the working unto himſelf as the laſt end, and the enjoyment of himſelf? that is Gods own happineſs: Now of ſuch excellency is the ſoul of man (however by ſin it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved) that it is capable of the underſtanding of an infinite eternal firſt beeing; it is capable of working towards this firſt beeing, as the laſt good of all, which is the ſame way and kinde of working, as God himſelf doth work.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>And it is capable of injoyment of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God himſelf;</hi> What is Gods happineſs, but to enjoy himſelf as the onely good? Now the ſoul of man is capable of the enjoyment of God, of having communion with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite firſt beeing of all things, and ſo hee is capable of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame life that God himſelf lives; for ſo the Scripture ſaith,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.18. Coloſ. 1.21.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Heathens were estranged from the life of God;</hi> ſo that it appears then, that beleevers are not eſtranged from the life of God, but do live the life of God in the injoyment of communion with himſelf: <hi>For indeed there could bee no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, except there were living the ſame kinde of life;</hi> as thus, A man and a beaſt cannot have communion together, why?
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:168883:106"/> becauſe they live not the ſame life one with another, their lives are of different kindes: ſo, were it not that the ſoul were capable of the ſame life that God lives, it could not bee capable of communion with God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, And further, <hi>The ſoul is of ſuch a nature, as it is capable of the communication of the choicest excellencies that ever God did, or will communicate unto any:</hi> Certainly there are very glorious excellencies in God, in the infinite foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all good, in the infinite firſt beeing of all things; and this God being an infinite good, doth take infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the communication of his goodneſs; Now I ſay, the ſouls of men are of ſuch a large extent, as they are ſome way capable of the enjoyment of any good that God hath to communicate, which hee hath revealed in his word; yea, and the truth is, when wee hear of Gods communicating of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Son, that hath a humane ſoul as well as a body, wee cannot but conceive that a humane ſoul is of that large extent, as it is capable of the higheſt and excellenteſt good that God hath to communicate to any Creature. We cannot but think that the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt hath as much of Gods goodneſs communicated to it, as ever creature had, or can have; now the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt is of the ſame nature with our ſouls, as his body; hee took the ſame kinde of fleſh as wee have, onely there was no ſin; and ſo the ſoul, it is the ſame kind of ſoul that wee have, onely it was not ſinful, as ours are: Now, if the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt bee capable of the higheſt good that God the infinite good hath to communicate to any creature, then the ſouls of men and women are alſo: howſoever you have look'd after your ſouls no further, but onely to bee ſerviceable to your bodies, to get meat and drink, and bee as it were <hi>ſalt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cujus anima eſt pro ſale.</note> as the Philoſopher ſaith of the Epicure, that the ſoul ſerves for no other end to him, but to keep his body from ſtinking; yet know, whatſoever thou art, though now a ſinful wretched vile creature, and art deprived of the chief excellency that thy ſoul is capable of, yet that ſoul of thine that thou haſt, is capable of the higheſt good thing that an infinite God hath to communicate: Oh that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:168883:107"/> God by your owning of this, would a little but raiſe your ſpirits to think that you have been deluded and deceived all this while: this is the excellency now of your ſouls, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto God.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, And yet there is in the next place <hi>A further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that your ſouls have to God, and that is the contiguity,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak, <hi>with God himſelf:</hi> that is, of all things that are here in this world, the ſoul of man it is that that is next unto God himſelf: Next to God, you will ſay, what do you mean when you ſay that the ſoul of man it is contiguous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? I mean this, that God hath made all creatures for himſelf, but hee hath made them all for himſelf to come to him by man; hee hath made all theſe inferiour things in the world for man, and man for himſelf, and ſo God comes to attain the end of all things in this world by man, ſo that man is next unto God: God would have the glory of all the creatures in the world, but how? by man: ſaith God, All theſe things that I have made, I will have them bee in ſubjection to man, for ſo they were in their firſt Creation; and as I ſhall appear in all other of my works, ſo ſhall this creature honour mee, and fear mee, and admire mee, and magnifie mee, upon the taking notice of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in that good that there is in any creature: All the goodneſs there is in the creature, it comes to mee, but how ſhall I have the glory of it all? why, I will make a creature that ſhall bee as it were between mee and other creatures, that ſhall partake of the nature of other creatures, but ſo as hee ſhall have a certain kinde of divine Beam of my excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and ſhall bee able to take notice of mee and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in my goodneſs; what hee doth receive in of the ſweetneſs of the creature, hee ſhall receive it in as my ſweet, and my goodneſs; Incoms from mee; and ſo hee ſhall reflect it upon my face again; ſo that mans ſoul is like a Glaſs; as you ſee a Glaſs that takes the beams of the Sun that ſhines upon it, and caſts it toward the Sun again, as upon a wall; the beams of the Sun comes into the Glaſs, and then the Glaſs can reflect it this way, or that way: So the glory of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:168883:107"/> God ſhines in the world, and mans ſoul is as the glaſs, and when it was in its firſt purity, was as a clear chryſtal glaſs, and received in all the beams of Gods glory, all the glory of God I ſay, that did ſhine in all his creatures, was received into mans ſoul, as the beams of the Sun into a glaſs, and now man was able to reflect the glory of theſe beams upon the face of God again, and to return all again to God; for as all things that are good come from him, ſo all good ſhould return again to him; but now, how comes the Lord to have an injoyment as it were of his goodneſs that hee lets out from himſelf? How comes hee to have it return back again to himſelf? Why, the way of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, it is by the Angels in heaven, and the ſpirits of men; theſe are the two excellent creatures that God doth make uſe of to fetch in all the glory that hee hath from all his creatures, that they in an active way ſhould reflect it all upon the face of God again; certainly the ſoul of man is of an excellent nature then, that is contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with God himſelf, next unto him; It is no matter whether a man bee rich or poor, learned or unlearned, yet hee hath a ſoul that is capable of this.</p>

                     <p>That it is ſatisfied onely with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, there is nothing can fill the ſoul of man to ſatisfie it, but God himſelf. For the true object of mans underſtanding, it is not this truth, or the other truth, but truth in general, and the higheſt truth, and that is God; and the object of this ſoul, it is not this or that good, but good in general, the higheſt and the chiefeſt good, and that is God: Let all the creatures in the world preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the ſoul of man to bee the portion of him, Mans ſoul would ſay, theſe are not the things that can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie mee; ſaith <hi>Austin,</hi> Lord thou haſt made us for thy ſelf, and our heart is unquiet till it comes unto thy ſelf,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:168883:111"/> and this is the excellency of mans ſoul, it is above all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; it is a vertue in the ſoul of man to have a holy kinde of pride, to think all creatures in the world to bee too little to bee the portion of it, and God takes this well, hee likes it well, that we ſhould know our own ſouls, ſo far, that wee ſhould have this kinde of pride of ſpirit, as wee may ſo call it, or rather a right elevation of ſpirit, to look upon all creatures in the world, as too low, and too mean to bee the portion of one immortal ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Many other things were delivered about the excellency of mans ſoul, that ſo you might know ſomething of your worth, that you are too good to bee ſlaves to the Devil, and it is good for you to know your own worth in this thing, that ſo your hearts might bee elevated above thoſe bare things that you ſought to have your happineſs in; all thoſe that ever have had true wiſdome, have accounted ſouls to bee very precious. I remember <hi>Zozomen</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian ſaith of the Martyrs, that they ſuffered torment in their bodies, as if they were other folks bodies, and not their own, they lookt not upon them as any part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but on their ſouls as themſelves; and ſo you finde it in Scripture that it is the ſoul of man, that is a mans ſelf. Compare for this, my Text in <hi>Matthew,</hi> with <hi>Luke</hi> 9. where you have the ſame ſpeech of our Saviour ſetting out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a mans ſoul. In the one it is, <hi>What will it profit a man, if hee gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> In the other it is, <hi>If hee loſe himſelf;</hi> this is all one, the loſing of a mans ſoul, and the loſing of himſelf: for a mans ſelf it is his ſoul, as for the body it is but the caſe, it is but the out-ſide, and ſo indeed ſome of the Heathens accounted their bodies. <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi>

                     <p>The Devil himſelf hath high eſteem of ſouls, the Devil cares not, ſo bee it hee may gain mens ſouls, what they have for their bodies; the Devil doth not envy any wicked man
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:168883:111"/> to proſper in this world, to have a healthful luſty body, and to have ſtature and ſtrength, and beauty; But now, if hee ſees that there bee any means for the good of their ſouls, hee envies that, may the Devil have but their ſouls, hee cares not what they have otherwayes.

                        </label> Surely then wee ought to look upon every childe of man with ſome reverent reſpect and honour; there is not the pooreſt childe (as I told you the laſt day) that lyes crying at your doors for a cruſt, but hath a ſoul in it more worth than heaven and earth. And the conſideration of this ſhould make us look upon the meaneſt childe, ſervant, the pooreſt body, with an honourable eſteem and reſpect; how ever the glory of their ſouls bee darkned for the preſent, yet they have ſtill in them ſuch ſouls as are capable of a kinde of infinite good, more than all the other works that ever God made, except the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; do not look upon your ſervants that are under you with ſcorn and contempt, do not uſe them doggedly, as if they were brute-beaſts; Remember, though you bee a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a Miſtreſs, a Governour, you are a Governour of one that hath an immortal ſoul, more worth than all the world. <hi>A good man,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>is merciful to his beaſt,</hi> and ſurely then a good man will bee merciful to one that hath an immortal ſoul, and it may bee an immortal ſoul better than his Governour; how many have more reſpect to Dogs, to brute-beaſts, than they have to ſervants and children, and poor people, who have immortal ſouls? I have read of the Turks, that though they bee noted for moſt cruel people to men, as you heard of their cruelty to thoſe in the Gallies, yet they are very pittiful to brute-beaſts, and therefore they will give alms and ſtipends out of charity, to maintain brute-beaſts withall; and there is a ſtory of a youth that abuſing a bird that had a long bill, was like to have been ſtoned to death in the ſtreet, they did ſo hate cruelty to thoſe kinde of creatures, though they bee cruel

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:168883:113"/> ſouls; but becauſe wee know that it is a great hinderance to the work of their Miniſtery, when brutiſh carnal ſpirits have low and mean eſteem of their work; therefore wee finde that the Apoſtle would ever bee ſetting up the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this work, <hi>Let a man eſteem of us as the diſpencers of the Myſteries of Chriſt,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and to eſteem of them very highly in love for their works ſake;</hi> And ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves: for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account: that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you.</hi> Oh it is a ſad thing! if one that God ſends to watch for the ſouls of people, ſhall bee forced to return his account to God with ſorrow of heart, and ſay, Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt what deſires I have had, and what indeavours to do good to the ſouls of this people, how it hath been my ſtudy, my prayer, to finde out what might bee moſt profitable for their ſouls, how willing I was to venture my life in ſeeking to do good to their ſouls; but Oh Lord! I have ſpent care, and ſtudy, and ſtrength, and even almoſt my life in vain; little good do I finde done to the ſouls of this people; Lord, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thy word, they contemn it, they minde it not; there are other things that their hearts are upon, to follow the luſts of their fleſh, as if ſo bee they had no immortal ſouls to look unto; I ſay, if any faithful Miniſter of God ſhall go to God and make his moan thus unto God with grief and trouble of heart, it will bee very ill for you; it will bee a fearful moan in the ears of God againſt a people, when any Miniſter ſhall juſtly make this to God againſt them; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle here, <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves: for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief.</hi> Conſider, ſo far as any have charge of ſouls, it is a heavy burden that is upon them, a heavy weight; ſurely, whoſoever ſhould take charge of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:168883:114"/> ſo many thouſand ſouls as belongs to this Congregation would have weight and burden enough upon his ſhoulders, you ſhould pitty them that have this charge over you. I remember <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his writing upon this very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaith, Hee wonders how any of theſe that are here ſaid to watch over mens ſouls, how any of them could bee ſaved, becauſe the charge is ſo great that is upon them: And I have read of one being called to the work of the Miniſtery, would by any means avoid it, and profeſſes that hee would not for all the world have the charge of a ſoul one day upon him. Certainly it is a great work, and requires very much ſeriouſneſs and diligence to have a ſoul committed to one. If a man had a precious Pearl com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his charge, that were worth ten thouſand pound, that hee muſt look to it, and keep it, hee would hardly bee able to ſleep quietly after hee had ſo great a charge committed to him; And truly, if men are careful that have but beaſts committed to them, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid concerning his Unkle <hi>Labans</hi> cattel, that hee look'd to them ſo as that hee indured the froſt in the night, and the heat of the day; much diligence and care then ſhould they have, that have the charge of ſouls: But wee let that paſs.</p>
                     <p>Yet in the fourth place, If ſouls have ſuch excellency, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>4</label> then certainly thoſe who have moſt ſoul-excellency, are the moſt excellent people; wee may judge here who they are that are the moſt excellent upon the earth, <hi>The Righteous is more excellent than his neighbour;</hi> perhaps his neighbour is richer than hee, hath a comlier body than hee, but yet hee is more excellent, why? becauſe all excellency muſt be judged by that that is moſt proper to the Creature, and that that is the chief part of the Creature; as if you would judge of the goodneſs of a knife, you will not judge by the haft of it, whether it bee good or no, but you will judge by the metal of the knife, you judge by that wherein the chief of the knife is; ſo, if you will judge of the excellency of a man or woman, you muſt judge of his excellency by the excellency of that that is moſt proper to him: Now, for

                        <hi>Senſe,</hi> for the body, why the brute-beaſts they have ſenſe, they have fleſh and blood as well as wee, onely wee dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in theſe rational immortal ſouls that God hath given to us; therefore ſuch, whoſe ſouls are filled with divine excellency, they are to bee moſt honoured, they are indeed the Lords and Ladies of the world; therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of thoſe, whoſe out-ſides were mean enough; in the latter end of the 11th. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that wandered in ſheep-skins and goat-skins, yet they were ſuch as the world was not worthy of them. Indeed, a man of underſtanding is of an excellent ſpirit; wee read of the Ark, the outſide was of Badgers-skins, it had a poor and mean outſide, but within were the Cherubims, and Gold was within; And ſo, many have very mean outſides, but within there is a great deal of excellency; and others that have brave outſides, and well clad without, yet if you look within them, oh what vile ſouls have they! <hi>the heart of the wicked is little worth,</hi> ſaith the Scripture; Perhaps his Land may bee ſomewhat worth, and his Houſe, but his heart is little worth; As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man that hath perhaps a hand full of ſores, yet may have a fine imbroidered Glove upon it; and a dunghill may bee ſtrewed with herbs, and in the winter time filthy dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills you know are covered with white Snow, that in a fair froſty day look as gliſtering as the Snow that is upon a fine Meddow, but ſtill nothing but filth: So it is with many a man that hath a fine outſide, covered over it may bee with a great many outward excellencies, but within their ſpirits nothing but carrion, nothing but abominable ſtuff that is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and loathſome in the eyes of God; as a ſore legg may have a fine ſtockin o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But that God that is a Spirit, that looks unto Spirit, and thoſe men that know what ſpiritual excellency means, if they ſee a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have a filthy, defiled, corrupt ſoul, they cannot but eſteem of them accordingly. Whatſoever the body, or the out-ſide bee, thoſe are the moſt excellent in Gods eſteem, and the holy Angels, and the Saints, that have the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:168883:115"/> ſouls, for that is the beſt part of man.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>5</label> But fifthly, If the ſoul of man bee ſo excellent, Oh let us bleſs God for our ſouls, bleſs God, I ſay, that hath given unto you theſe immortal ſouls that are of ſo great a worth: Oh what cauſe have every one of you to bleſs God that hee did not make you a Toad, a Dog, a Snake, that hee did not make you any vile brute creature, but that when you were before him in the common lump out of which God made his creatures, that hee would rather chooſe you to bee one that ſhould have an immortal ſoul, ſo precious, rather than to bee a brute creature? Bleſs God, I ſay for this, for by this means,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, You are looked upon by the Angels themſelves, with honour, and with reſpect, till ſuch time as the Angels certainly know your Reprobation, and that you bee ſent down to hell: Though you bee wicked for the preſent, and your ſouls bee defiled, yet the Angels know nothing but that theſe ſouls, though now much fallen from God, may bee ſuch as may live with them to injoy eternal communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God together with them, and therefore they look upon you with honour.</p>
                     <p>And the providence of God it is more towards you, than towards any other creature in the world. Doth God take care for Oxen? ſaith the Scripture: True, the providence of God it is over all his works, there is not the leaſt worm that ſtirs without his providence. I, but doth God take care for Oxen? that is, as if the Holy Ghoſt there ſhould ſay, the providence of God over other creatures, it is nothing in compariſon of that it is over the ſpirits of men, over thoſe that have immortal ſouls: When God looks upon the creature, that hee hath given an immortal ſoul too, why ſaith God, My Providence ſhall in a ſpecial manner bee over this ſoul: And certainly the thoughts of God have been from all eternity working towards thoſe that have immortal ſouls, in a more ſpecial manner than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any of his other creatures; how ever you think of God, yet that is certain, God hath had his thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:168883:115"/> you one way or other from all eternity, and intends to fetch out a great deal of honor to his name from you one way or other, and therefore his Providence is towards you; God obſerves you, and marks you what way you take, his eye is upon you, for hee intends to bring ſome great glory out of you, God will not loſe his creature fully, you may loſe your own ſouls, but God will not loſe the glory that hee might have from you, but hee will have glory from you one way or other.</p>
                     <p>And if God hath given you immortal ſouls, you have cauſe to bleſs him, becauſe whatſoever you are now, yet you are ſuch as are capable of all the good that ever Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed, and therefore it is a happy thing for one to have an immortal ſoul, becauſe they are not out of capacity of receiving that good that the Lord Chriſt hath purchaſed for his people; the brute beaſts are not capable, they are capable of no higher good, but to eat and drink, and live here a while, and have their ſenſes to bee pleaſed, and there is an end of them, but know, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art, thou art capable of all the good that ever Chriſt hath purchaſed, and therefore thy condition is a great deal better in that reſpect than the condition of all other creatures in the world. And thou having a ſoul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, God hath made thee for eternity one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hee intends for to have thee to live to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in one condition or other: Now it is I ſay, a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to bee made ſuch a creature, as that God ſhould have thoughts about from all eternity.</p>
                     <p>It may bee you will ſay, <hi>It were better that it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I confeſs ſuch is the condition of ſome through their ſin, living and dying in it, that it were better ten thouſand times that they had been Dogs, or Toads, and Serpents, I but that is but through thy wickedneſs, but it cannot bee ſaid of the vildeſt alive, for there is none of you, but for ought Angels or men know, may live eternally to the praiſe of Gods grace in Chriſt, you have ſuch kinde of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:168883:116"/> as are capable of it. Now it is true, if you ſhould dye in your ſins, then it might bee ſaid at that inſtance when you dye in your ſins, that it had been better that you had been Toads or Serpents, or any thing in the world: But were not this a ſad thing for a man that hath ſuch an excellent nature, to live and dye ſo that they may wiſh hereafter that they had been Toads or Dogs? how many are there that are willing, ſo they may live like a beaſt, to dye like a beaſt, I but that thou canſt not bring thy ſelf to dye like a beaſt, thou muſt be infinitly worſe, or infinitly better than the brute beaſts. But bleſs God that thou haſt a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of ſo much good, whatſoever thou art in other reſpects, though God hath made a great difference between thee and others that are of the ſame kinde in thy outward eſtate, God hath made a great deal of difference between poor and rich, between a poor Alms-body that lives in ſo mean a condition, and between a Noble-man, a Prince, an Emperour; I but this difference is made in the outward eſtate and body, but there is no ſuch difference made in their ſouls, thou haſt as precious a ſoul within thee, that is naturally as good as ever any Emperour had in the world, ſo Philoſophers ſay of the ſouls of men, mens ſouls are equal, and one is not better than another by nature, what they are better by is afterwards, by education, or by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of the graces of God, but by nature all men are equal. And therefore that wherein mans excellency is, is in his ſoul, thou art as high as any Emperour in the world, and therefore it is that the Scripture would have no difference made between the ſouls of men, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.15. you ſhall finde there by that Scripture, that God would not have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made of the ſouls of men, it is ſaid in the 14. verſe, <hi>Every one that paſſeth among you, that are numbred from twenty years old and above, ſhall give an offering unto the Lord;</hi> God would have an offering from every one of them: Now mark what hee ſaith in the 15. verſe, <hi>The rich ſhall not give more, and the poor ſhall not give leſs than half a ſhekel when they give an offering unto the Lord to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:168883:116"/> for their ſouls;</hi> There muſt bee the ſame attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for ſouls, both for the rich, and for the poor. And as wee ſpake the laſt day in opening the excellency of the ſoul, it appears by the price that was paid for it; ſo here they are equal in this, that the poor mans ſoul muſt have as great a price paid to ſave it, as the richeſt man in the world. And therefore bleſs God for thy ſoul in this, that hee hath made thee equal with the Kings and Princes of the world in that that is thy more noble, and more excellent part.</p>
                     <p>And bleſs God for ſoul-mercies above all mercies; If the ſoul bee ſo excellent, then I ſay, bleſs God that hath granted thee ſoul-mercies, though hee hath denied thee bodily-mercies, it is no great matter; as ſuppoſe, If ſo bee that God ſhould take away the ſight of thine eyes, yet if hee opens the eyes of thine underſtanding, of thy ſoul, thou art happy: Suppoſe that thou art lame in thy body, yet if thou canſt walk in the wayes of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and run there, thou art a happy creature: It may be thou wanteſt food, I, but if God feed thy ſoul with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Manna, feed thee every day with food from heaven, and take care for the feeding of thy ſoul, thou art not ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as thou thoughtſt thy ſelf; thou haſt tattered cloaths, I but if God hath provided the righteouſneſs of his Son to bee a garment to cloach thy ſoul, every time thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareſt before him, thou art a happy creature in that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thy heart is ready to murmure, that God hath denied thee bodily mercies that hee hath granted to others, think with thy ſelf, I but hath not God recompenced mee in ſoul mercies? I make no queſtion but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls that bleſs God that ever they have lived to this time, though they have ſuffered hard things for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, many that have loſt, and been plundered of all, yet bleſs God that they have lived to the time wherein there was ſo much plenty of the food of ſouls: Oh thoſe truths of God that have been revealed unto us ſince thoſe times, but had thoſe that had the power before, had the power ſtill continued, wee had never had ſuch truths made known
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:168883:117"/> unto us, they account all recompenced in ſoul-mercies, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed bee the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in Chriſt.</hi> Mark what the Apoſtle ſaith there, his heart is filled with this, <hi>Bleſſed bee God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Wherefore? that hee hath given us good trading, and good incomes, that hath given us food and rayment, wee are to bleſs God for this, I but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles heart was above this, therefore ſaith hee, <hi>Bleſſed bee the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt,</hi> they are the bleſſings indeed that wee have cauſe to bleſs him for, ſpiritual bleſſings, ſoul-mercies; as for bodily-mercies, wee know that the Heathens and Reprobates have had as great a ſhare in as any in the world; but bleſſed bee God, though wee bee denied theſe outward bodily favours, yet wee have ſpiritual bleſſings. <hi>Oh thanks bee to God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſsings in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi> And this now would bee a good argument that you do know the worth of your ſouls; if you can be bleſſing of God for ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in Jeſus Chriſt, above all bleſſings, and account your ſelves rich enough, if you have the riches of ſpiritual bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>And then further, Oh if the ſoul of man bee ſo precious, What great pitty is it that God ſhould not have the honour of mens ſouls, of ſuch a noble and excellent creature; it is great pitty that there ſhould bee any creature under the Sun that God ſhould not have the honour of; that God ſhould not have honour from every pile of graſs, from every bit of bread that is eaten, from every ſtone in the ſtreet: But now that God ſhould give to mankinde ſuch an excellent ſpirit, a ſoul more precious than all the world, and yet that God ſhould not have the glory of this, Oh this is an evil thing under the Sun indeed, this muſt needs go to the heart of God; for the truth is, God hath his glory from all other creatures by the ſoul of man. As for other creatures, hee hath his glory but paſſively from them, but for mans ſoul hee
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:168883:117"/> doth expect to have his glory actively from that: that man by his ſoul ſhould come to know this God, the infinite firſt-being of all things, ſhould fear him, and worſhip him, and ſerve him, and have communion with him, and praiſe him; and therefore <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>My ſoul praiſe thou the Lord, and all that is within mee praiſe his holy name.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, hee concludes, <hi>My ſoul praiſe thou the Lord.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. Now upon the conſideration of what hath been ſaid of the excellency of our ſouls, wee ſhould lay a charge upon them, that they do honour God, and ſerve God: What a ſad charge will this bee to many a man at the great day, when God ſhall ſay, Haddeſt thou been made a Dog, I never had had ſo much diſhonour as I have had, I ſhould have had more honour if I had made thee a Dog, there I ſhould have had my honour paſſively, and no diſhonour from thee? But now, thou being made an immortal ſoul, as it was capable of honouring mee, ſo of ſinning againſt mee; the more excellent a thing is, the more capable of evil it is, as well as of good; no creatures, but Angels and men are able to ſin againſt God. Oh it is pitty that God ſhould not have the honour of thy immortal ſoul. God had more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when hee was driven out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the beaſts, than when hee ſat upon the Throne as a King.</p>
                     <p>And then further, that ſhould have been another Uſe, to have laboured to perſwade you to take heed of diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſouls of yours. God hath put a great deal of glory and excellency upon them, do not you diſhonour them; and many wayes ſhould have been ſaid how men do put diſhonour upon their ſouls; only for the concluſion; Oh that you would but learn to love your own ſouls: <hi>To love them.</hi> It is a ſtrange exhortation you will ſay to exhort men to love their ſouls: Oh, that you would but do it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. <hi>David</hi> calls his ſoul his <hi>Darling,</hi> the ſouls of men ſhould bee indeed their Darlings, not their bodies. It was a ſpeech of a Courtier to his friend, ſaith hee, I love you as mine own ſoul; Oh ſaith hee, then you love mee not at all;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:168883:118"/> if you had ſaid you had loved mee as your body, then I ſhould have thought you had loved mee, but I ſee no love you have to your ſoul; It was the prayer of the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> in the Epiſtle that hee writ to his hoſt <hi>Gaius,</hi> I ſuppoſe you that know Scripture, are not unacquainted with it, in his third Epiſtle, <hi>Beloved, I wiſh above all things that thou mayeſt proſper, and bee in health, even as thy ſoul proſpereth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall cloſe all I intend for the preſent with this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it ſeems that <hi>Gaius</hi> was a holy man, but a man of a weakly and ſick body, and therefore St. <hi>John</hi> writing to him, hee prayes thus, <hi>Above all things, I deſire that thy body may but proſper, as thy ſoul proſpereth.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, O <hi>Gaius,</hi> thou haſt an excellent gracious ſoul, indued with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable graces of the Spirit of God, full of God thy ſoul is, though thy body bee weakly: Oh that thou hadſt but as good a body, as thou haſt a ſoul. It ſeems <hi>Gaius</hi> had more care of his ſoul a great deal, than of his body: but now my brethren conſider this, Would not this bee a curſe to moſt men for one to pray thus for them, <hi>Oh Lord, give them ſuch bodies, as they have ſouls?</hi> it were as much as to ſay, <hi>Lord, Let that body bee blaſted, let it bee filled with diſeaſes, let it bee filled with rottenneſs, let it conſume away, let it bee a noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and loathſome body, for his ſoul is ſo;</hi> The ſouls of moſt men are filled with diſeaſes, are noyſome and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the eyes of God. It is a happy thing, my brethren, to have better ſouls than bodies, that was the happineſs of <hi>Gaius,</hi> and ſo it would bee your happineſs, if you could ſay ſo; you have great care of the bodies of your children, I, but have you a greater care of their ſouls? if you have, it would bee an excellent ſign that God hath made you to underſtand what true excellency means. It is a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion among Divines, and among Philoſophers too, about the propagation of the ſoul, how it comes in, whether by the Parents, or immediate creation; truly there is one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it is not like to come in by the Parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ſee that there is ſcarce any Parents that have any care of the ſouls of their children, but altogether ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:168883:118"/> that their bodies may bee fine, and that they may bee brave; and as they look at their children, ſo they look at themſelves, they love their bodies to the uttermoſt, to make proviſion for the fleſh, but no further. What a deal of do would there bee, if when any of your children goes abroad, or husband, or wife, If you ſhould hear that they have gotten a fall and broke their legs or arms? but now when you go abroad, and fall into ſin, and get a wound to your ſouls, as every ſin it gives a deadly wound, yea ſuch a wound as onely the blood of Jeſus Chriſt is able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> cure it; and there is nothing made of all this, as if wee were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but lumps of fleſh: Oh have a care of your ſouls, and labour to love them, and make them to bee your Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; you had need have a care of them, for as they are precious, ſo they are tender; as it is with Watches and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Inſtruments, thoſe that are moſt curious are the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt hurt, the very air will put them out of temper; and ſo the ſouls of men, becauſe they are things ſo excellent, they are things of a very curious nature, and a little thing wil hurt them. As a little thing will hurt the eye, for that is a more excellent member than your finger or leg; ſo the ſoul is a more excellent part, and therefore it is that that is moſt in danger to bee hurt and miſchiefed, yea and to periſh, and if your ſoul periſhes, your body will follow after, what will become of that if your ſoul bee loſt and periſh? but the onely way to love your bodies well, and aright, it is to love your ſouls.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall ſpeak ſomething unto a Uſe that was mentioned the laſt day, and that was this,</p>
                     <p>If God hath given unto us ſuch precious ſouls, Oh then let not us diſhonour our ſouls: Diſhonour them, Why, how may a man diſhonour his ſoul?</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Why firſt when hee lives idlely, and makes no uſe at all of it, any more than if hee had but the ſoul of a Brute. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.5. ſpeaking of him that had not lift up his ſoul unto vanity, I remember the old Latin <hi>Arius Montanus</hi> turns it, <hi>Hee that hath received his ſoul in vain.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt people do receive their ſouls from God in vain, or to no purpoſe, they make no more uſe of them than the Philoſopher ſaid of the Swine that had his ſoul onely as ſalt to keep the fleſh from ſtinking; there is all the uſe many
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:168883:119"/> men make of their ſouls, onely to keep their bodies from ſmelling, and from corruption.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Wee diſhonour our ſouls when wee imploy them about low and mean things unworthy of them, and make them to bee the chief things that wee imploy them about; It is the miſery of man ſo to do, that I ſpake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it is the ſin of man ſo to do: How many men that have ſuch precious immortal ſouls as theſe are, know no higher good to imploy them about, than to bee it may bee all day or night in ſhuffling a pair of Cards, or caſting of Dice, or at Tables? there is the higheſt good that they know how to imploy their ſouls about. What a poor mean low thing is this, what a diſhonour to ſuch a ſoul as this? If ſo bee any of you have ſervants that are of good breeding, good parentage, that are of excellent parts, that have lived long with you, that have skill in your Trade, if you ſhould ſet them to do nothing but pick ſtraws, they would account it a great diſhonour put upon them. Truly what do you with theſe precious immortal ſouls of yours that are ſo much worth, even more than the world, but imploy them in ſuch poor things, even to pick ſtraws as it were? if a man ſhould have pearls, that every one of them were worth a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and hee ſhould know no other uſe to make of them than to ſtop holes in Mud walls, one would think it, as to bee great folly in him, ſo a great diſhonour put upon thoſe pearls that are of ſo much worth; why your ſouls are more worth every one of them than all the Pearls and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in the world, and for you to do nothing elſe but ſpend the ſtrength of your ſouls about gathering of a little dirt together here in this world, it is a great diſhonour to your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Wee have a ſtory of <hi>Domitian</hi> that was a great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and yet hee had ſuch a low and mean ſpirit, as that hee would ſpend the greateſt part of his time in catching of Flies. This is recorded of him as an argument of the lowneſs and meanneſs of his ſpirit, unworthy a man of ſo great a dignity: Oh ſo our ſouls that God hath made
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:168883:120"/> ſo high and put ſuch glory upon, what are they buſied about in moſt people? I remember <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> hee tells of ſome, and among others of <hi>Origen,</hi> to bee of that opinion, that the ſouls of men were made altogether at the firſt Creation, and lived glorious ſpirits till they ſinned againſt God, and all thoſe that ſinned againſt God were thruſt into the bodies of men, as into a priſon, and thoſe that did not ſin, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ive ſtill with God in glory. And <hi>Jerome,</hi> as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member in his 32. Epiſt. ſpeaks of that opinion that did prevail; and wee finde <hi>Plato,</hi> though a heathen, hee ſpeaks of the ſouls of men, and thought that they were made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together before their bodies, if not from eternity. Theſe men they thought the ſouls of men ſo precious, as that they could not come into the bodies of men but for their faults, as a puniſhment to them, becauſe they ſaw how meanly mens ſouls lived while they were in their bodies, and therefore thought it impoſſible for ſuch a precious ſoul as a man had, to come to live ſo meanly, were it not for Gods anger puniſhing the ſoul for ſome ſin or other: Oh do not diſhonour them by imploying of them about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and low things.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Do not diſhonour them by defiling of them by caſting filth, and dirt upon them. Would not a Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelf diſhonoured, to have the filth and dirt of the ſtreet to bee caſt into his face? Certainly, when thou doeſt defile thy ſoul by ſin, when thou doeſt ſin, thou doeſt as vile an act as caſting dirt in the face of a Prince. There is no Princes body upon earth ſo excellent as the ſoul of the pooreſt and meaneſt man, no filth in the world ſo vile as the filth of ſin, and by thy ſin thou doeſt caſt this filth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſoul, and ſo doeſt all beſmear it, and defile it. You love to have clean and handſome bodies, and are loath to come into company all beſmeared and beſooted: Oh but how often do you go into the preſence of God moſt abominable and loathſome! Oh do not put that diſhonour upon your ſouls!</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Do not diſhonour your ſouls by making them
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:168883:120"/> drudges to your bodies, by making them to bee Caters to provide for the body, and to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh; <hi>I have ſeen</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) ſervants upon horſes,</hi>

                           </gap>.</note> 
                        <hi>and Princes walking as ſervants upon the earth.</hi> This was an evil <hi>Solomon</hi> thought, but to ſee our baſe vile bodies to bee ſet up, and our ſouls to bee brought under, and ſervants and ſlaves to this body, Oh how vile is it! If you ſhould ſee a great Prince to bee made a ſlave to ſome Scullion-boy, you would account it a great leaving of his condition, and diſhonour put upon him, but while thou makeſt thy ſoul to bee a ſlave to thy body, it is worſe a great deal. <hi>Seneca,</hi> though hee were but a Heathen, yet hath this notable ſpeech, <hi>I am greater, and born to greater things, than that I ſhould bee a drudge to my body, and the ſlave of my body:</hi> A Heathen thought himſelf too great, and born to greater things than that ever hee ſhould bring that ſoul of his to bee a drudge and ſlave to his body. And indeed did wee know our ſouls, wee ſhould think ſo, and wee ſhould never make them drudges to our bodies, meerly to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh; and yet how many men and women are loath to dye, only upon this ground, becauſe that then they ſhall have no more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the luſts of the fleſh? Oh what diſhonour is there put upon this precious and excellent ſoul in this? but much more diſhonour when thou makeſt it a drudge and ſlave to the Devil? it is an evil to have our ſouls to bee ſlaves to our bodies, but a greater evil to bee a ſlave and drudge to the Devil, that the Devil ſhould have command of them, and carry them up and down as hee pleaſes. I remember, it is reported of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and another Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour that did uſe to call themſelves the vaſſals of Chriſt; but as for thoſe precious ſouls now to bee vaſſals to the Devil, Oh this is too great a diſhonour that is put upon them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Again, you diſhonour your ſouls by grudging the time and coſt that is ſpent upon them; how many men and women think the time is loſt that is ſpent upon their ſouls more immediately! they muſt indeed ſometime <hi>pray,</hi> and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:168883:121"/> ſometime <hi>hear</hi> the word, but the time, and all the charge they are at for their ſouls, they look upon it even almoſt as loſt, and ſo grudge it, and ſo would fain bee about ſome thing for their bodies; ſpeak to them about praying in their families, they have buſineſs, and what is all their buſineſs for, but onely for their bodies? Indeed wee ſhould rather turn our plea the other way, and bee loath to ſpare time for our outward eſtate, rather than for our ſouls, thoſe immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls of ours; it is a wonder, how any one that knows the worth of his ſoul, can finde in his heart, but upon meer neceſſity, and out of duty, to ſpare time for his outward condition. The ſoul is diſhonoured when the time and coſt that is beſtowed about it is grudged, as if it were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, and caſt away.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Again wee diſhonour our ſouls when as wee lay not up proviſion for them againſt an evil day, this is a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour put upon them.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, And laſtly, you diſhonour your ſouls, when as you think to ſatisfie them with any thing but God himſelf; if you ſhould have any of your friends that are of quality come to your houſe, if you ſhould ſet a bowl of ſwill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and think to ſatisfie their hunger that way, they would think it a great diſhonour to them. Now if you do think to ſatisfie your ſouls with any thing here but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, you do as it were bring bones to ſet before a Prince. It was a ſpeech unworthy of a man which wee read of in the Goſpel concerning rich <hi>Dives, Soul, Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years.</hi> Soul, Soul, eat, drink, and take thine eaſe; Why, what had that to do with eating and drinking? How unworthy was this, I ſay, of one that had an immortal ſoul thus to ſpeak: Oh this is a great diſhonour that is put upon the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Now then learn wee in a right way to put honour upon our ſouls, and to love them, and make them our Darlings; and manifeſt your love to your ſouls,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By having your thoughts often upon them; wee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt our love to a friend by having our thoughts run upon
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:168883:121"/> him: Oh let your thoughts run much upon your ſouls, I am thus and thus in regard of my outward eſtate; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my body, through Gods mercy I have all my limbs and ſenſes, and comfortable proviſion for it: Oh but my ſoul, how is it with thee? bee often conferring with your ſouls, as you know one friend loves to confer with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: Can you ſay you love ſuch a friend that is your next neighbour, and never ſpend any time in conference together, ſcarce ever ſpeak one with another? Certainly ſo it is with the ſouls of men, they think but little of the tearms that their ſouls are in with God, of what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons their ſouls are in, whether good or bad, and the day is yet to come wherein many a man hath ſpent one half hour in conference with his ſoul, to know how tearms do ſtand between his ſoul and the Almighty God: Oh love your ſouls by thinking on them, and thinking often what ſhould become of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And further, love them by making them Empereſſes of your bodies, by keeping your bodies under them: Thoſe that the Scripture ſets out unto us which have had the moſt precious ſouls, they have ever more beat down their bodies, and kept them low: You know <hi>Paul</hi> that was one of the moſt precious ſpirited men that ever lived upon the face of the earth, yet ſaith hee, <hi>I beat down my body,</hi> I beat it <hi>black and blew, leſt after I have preached to others, I my ſelf become a Reprobate;</hi> hee did not think his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conſiſt in pampering his body, no, but hee beat it down, and therein hee ſhewed his love to his ſoul, in that hee made his ſoul to bee Empereſs as it were.</p>
                     <p>It is the ſpeech of a learned man upon thoſe words, <hi>Subdue the earth,</hi> that is thy body, and all earthly things, to that ſpiritual part of thine, thy ſoul. If one ſhould tell you what the ancient Martyrs, and worthy Inſtruments of God that were precious men in their time, how hardly they uſed their bodies, it would hardly bee beleeved by you; but this is certain, there was never any that knew the true worth of their ſouls, but they made them the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſſes
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:168883:122"/> of their bodies. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> No man was ever ſuch a ſervant to his Maſter, as <hi>Valentinians</hi> body was to his ſoul; Bring your bodies down, and therein you will ſhew the greateſt love unto your ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And further, Adorn your ſouls, labour to put come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and beauty upon them as much as you can, and therein you will ſhew love and reſpect to them: Adorn them with thoſe graces that may make them amiable and lovely in the eyes of God himſelf, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Bee cloathed with humility.</hi> Thoſe that underſtand the Greek language, know it to bee a word that ſignifies a dreſs that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women uſe to have upon their heads with ribands, ſuch as they did uſe to wear in thoſe dayes, and ſo they thought themſelves very comely, and the Apoſtle alludes to thoſe kinde of dreſſes. Oh <hi>humility</hi> is the fineſt dreſs for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world, and ſo for men too. The fineſt cloaths that you can put upon you is the cloaths of humility; and ſo any grace of Gods Spirit it is the cloathing of the ſoul: Oh therefore ſhew your love unto your ſouls by labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deck and adorn them with ſuch cloathing as this is.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And ſhew your love to your ſouls by providing for them, while God affords means, labour to underſtand the want of your ſouls, and bee willing to bee at any charge and coſt for the good of them: If your head ake, or you have any little pain in any of your members, how do you ſeek out, and are willing to bee at a great deal of charge that you may have eaſe for your bodies? now ſeek out for your ſouls, the one is a ſign that you love your bodies well, and the other will bee a ſign that you love your ſouls as well.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And then ſhew love to your ſouls in the excellency of them, in things that are ſuitable to them, in converſing with God and Jeſus Chriſt, with the myſteries of the Goſpel, and with heavenly things.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Shew your love to them in labouring to bring them to the attaining of that end that they were made for, the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:168883:122"/> uttermoſt happineſs that they are capable of; then indeed you ſhew true love to your ſouls, when as your care is to bring them to the attainment of that end that God made them for: Certainly when God made a creature of ſo much excellency, hee did intend a glorious end for it: And let this now bee your great care, and manifeſt your love to your ſouls, I ſay, in this, by labouring to attain the end that God made them for. But this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt point, of the preciouſneſs and excellency of our ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Wee come now to the ſecond, and that is the main Point indeed in the Text, that is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the loſs of this ſoul is a moſt dreadful loſs.</hi> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct </seg>2</label> 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will hee give for his life;</hi> Even the Devil himſelf could ſay ſo. The loſs of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life wee account a great evil, and therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls Death by the name of the <hi>King of Terrours;</hi> and is it ſo great an evil to loſe a bodily life, to have the ſoul and body but ſeparated? Is the face of a bodily death ſo gaſtly? Oh how great an evil, and how gaſtly is the face of the eternal death, and the loſs of the immortal ſoul? This Point my brethren, is a Point of exceeding great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to underſtand; wee ſhall therefore,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Inquire what wee mean by the loſs of the ſoul, or when may the ſoul bee ſaid to bee loſt?</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing, Wherein doth the dreadfulneſs of the loſs of the ſoul conſiſt?</p>
                     <p>And then thirdly, I ſhall diſcover to you ſome aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the evil of the loſs of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, And then wee ſhall come to apply all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt then, What doth Chriſt mean when hee ſaith, <hi>What profiteth it a man, if hee gain the whole world, and loſe his ſoul?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, You are to know this, That wee are not ſaid to loſe our ſouls, becauſe they ſhall bee annihilated, and ceaſe to bee, the ceaſing of the ſoul to bee, that is not the loſs of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:168883:123"/> the ſoul, the ceaſing indeed of our bodily lives is the loſs of our lives, but it is not ſo with the ſoul, for the ſoul of no man or woman ſhall bee loſt ſo.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and this would not bee the greateſt loſs for the ſoul to ceaſe to bee. There are two degrees of evil that are beyond the evil of ceaſing to bee; to bee miſerable, to bee in pain and torture, is worſe than not to bee, and to bee ſinful, is worſe than to bee in pain; and therefore the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to bee, is not the greateſt evil: What is the loſs of the ſoul then?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The loſs of the ſoul it is firſt in the privation of it of all the good and excellency that the ſoul is capable of, the privation of the true good that the ſoul was made for.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It conſiſts in its departing and wandring from God: As a ſheep is ſaid to bee a loſt ſheep that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders up and down in the wilderneſs; ſo that is a loſt ſoul that wanders away from God the fountain of all good.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It conſiſts in the ſubjecting of it to that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and evil that is contrary to what good it is capable of.</p>
                     <p>And then fourthly, and laſtly, in the ſuccourleſs and helpleſs condition that it is brought into; wee uſe the phraſe of Loſt to all theſe things; when a man hath loſt his eſtate, wee account ſuch a man as a loſt man; and when a man is brought into a great deal of miſery, that heretofore was in a great deal of happineſs, wee account ſuch a man to bee a loſt man; but eſpecially when a man is ſuccourleſs and helpleſs, when hee hath no way to help and relieve himſelf, then hee is a loſt man indeed: And according to the degrees of theſe four things then a ſoul may bee ſaid to bee loſt. And here for the preſent every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſoul in the world by nature is a loſt ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Every man and woman, as they come into the world are deprived of the glory and excellency that God did indow the ſouls of men withall in their firſt creation, wee are all deprived of the glory of God, ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:168883:123"/>
                     <p>And ſecondly, All our ſouls do now naturally wander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God, continually depart, and wander from the infinite glorious firſt-being of all things; Thou that art an old man or woman that haſt lived many years, and God hath not revealed himſelf in working the true work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in thee, to change thy eſtate, know, that thy ſoul hath been departing and wandring from the Lord all the dayes of thy life, to this very preſent, thou art like a loſt ſheep, wandring up and down in the wilderneſs, and in danger to bee deſtroyed every minute of an hour by ſome wilde beaſt or other; though it is true, thy ſoul is not made a prey to the Devil ſo as to deſtroy thee utterly, yet thou haſt been in danger all the while thou haſt been wandring from the Lord to bee made a prey upon by the Devil, and utterly to have been caſt away.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and thirdly, There is a great deal of miſery upon thy ſoul, if thou kneweſt it; as, contrary to that light that hee hath ſet up in thy underſtanding, there is blindneſs in thee, there is errour in thee; contrary to that holineſs that was at firſt in thy heart and ſoul, there is nothing but ſin and wickedneſs, all the ſpauns and ſeeds of all kinde of ſin is in thy heart; there is a great deal of that evil that is contrary to what thy ſoul was made withall at firſt, there is enmity in thy ſoul againſt God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and fourthly, Thy ſoul is in a ſuccourleſs, helpleſs, ſhiftleſs condition in reſpect of what thou art able to do, or what all the creatures in heaven or earth are able to do for thee; let all the Angels in heaven, and men in the world, joyn together to ſeek to do good to thy ſoul, they are not able to deliver thy ſoul from that evil that now it is in, and that it is in further danger of. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that phraſe that you have in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> Wee are all loſt ſheep going aſtray, and Jeſus Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave loſt ſouls; Souls deprived of the glory of God, Souls wandring away from God, Souls filled with evil, Souls ſuccourleſs, and helpleſs in regard of any
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:168883:124"/> power in any creature in heaven and earth to ſave them: Chriſt beholding how ſuch precious ſouls were every one of them loſt, if hee had not come to ſave them, hee was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come from heaven to ſeek and to ſave ſouls thus loſt.</p>
                     <p>Now though ſouls bee for the preſent in a loſt condition, yet there is a further loſs of the ſoul than this; for if the ſoul be neglected here, it will bee loſt forever; there are many that are loſt now for the preſent, and yet afterwards Chriſt findes them, and there is joy in heaven at the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; but there is a loſs that ſhall bee eternal, and that loſs is more dreadful than the former, yet the former hath the degree of it, but that the perfection of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Now the loſs of the ſoul in hell conſiſts in theſe three particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The full and perfect eternal rejection of the ſoul from God, and from all good in him together, with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all kinde of evil that the ſoul is capable of; this is the condition of a loſt ſoul that periſhes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, And then in the next place it conſiſts in the making of this ſoul to bee perfectly ſenſible of the loſs of that good, and of all the evil it is poſſeſt withall, making of it perfectly ſenſible of it: Here men and women are in loſt conditions, but they know it not, they are not ſenſible of it: But God will bring the ſoul into ſuch a condition, as it ſhall bee made perfectly ſenſible of the loſs of all the good that it might have had, and of all the evil that is upon it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And then laſtly, It ſhall bee in ſuch a condition, ſo ſuccourleſs, ſo helpleſs, as is not onely beyond the power of Angels, and all men to help it; but I ſay, ſo ſuccourleſs, ſo loſt, as that Gods mercy, and all the good there is in Chriſt ſhall never ſave it, and as God hath ſet and ordered things, can never ſave it.</p>
                     <p>Now then theſe things being opened to you, you will underſtand what this Text means: When you read this Text you think there may bee truth in it, and in general you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But now becauſe it is a point of ſo great moment, I will not ſatisfie my ſelf meerly in telling you theſe things, but endeavour to open them unto you, what the evil of this loſs is, that if it might bee, by preſenting this before the ſouls of men, they may ſee more the danger that they are in, and how the Devil hath gulled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them all this while: It may make many ſouls to bee at a ſtand, if they come to know what this loſs indeed doth mean. Now I ſhall endeavour the opening of this in the three laſt particulars that I named.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For the rejection of the ſoul from God ſo as to bee deprived of all the good there is in God, and that it is capable of; Now for the underſtanding of the evil of this, wee muſt inquire what is that good that the ſouls of men are capable of, or elſe wee cannot come to underſtand what an evil thing it is to loſe it.</p>
                     <p>Now for the good that the ſoul is capable of, I will but onely name ſome heads unto you, for in a Treatiſe that ſome of you have in your hands, of <hi>Moſes looking to the recompenſe of reward,</hi> there are the principal heads of the good and excellency that the ſoul is capable of, and ſhall bee bleſſed in heaven eternally with: And the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loſs of theſe things, will diſcover much, The firſt part of the evil of the loſs of the ſoul. I will but in a very brief way preſent them unto you.</p>
                     <p>Why the Glory of God upon the ſoul, the Image of God, the Life of God, the Divine nature that the ſoul is capable of: Now for the ſoul never to live the Life of God, nor to have his Image, nor any of the Glory of Gold upon it, this is a fearful evil to thoſe that know the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of theſe things; of the bleſſed viſion of God in heaven, to ſee him that is the infinite firſt-being of all things, to ſee him as hee is, to ſee him that hath all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in him, and to ſee all the good there is in God, as the good of the ſoul. The ſoul is capable of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the minde of God, to have all the glorious
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:168883:125"/> Counſels of God about his works and wayes that hee hath had from all eternity to bee revealed unto, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it, and as any way may make it happy: To live to ſee what the wayes of God have been from all eternity, and what they ſhall bee to all eternity, and that for the good of this ſoul, that it may bee for ever in his preſence, and to ſtand and look upon his face, and ſee him as the portion of it, Oh this muſt needs bee a glorious thing: Certainly if the preſence of God put ſuch a glory upon the heavens, it muſt needs put abundance of glory upon the ſoul that ſhall ſtand immediately alwayes in his preſence: To have eternal communion with God, that is, to have the imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, imbracing the ſoul, and delighting himſelf in it above all other his works, but onely the Angels and his Son; delighting, I ſay, himſelf in the ſoul, and imbracing it, communicating and letting out himſelf in all his luſtre and glory when hee ſhall have inlarged the ſoul to bee able to the uttermoſt to receive in that glory that hee hath to communicate: And for him to converſe with the ſouls of men to all eternity in a familiar way, as one friend with another; and for the ſoul to bee letting out its ſelf again to God, for that is in communion, there is Gods letting out himſelf to it, and its letting out its ſelf again to God; now, I ſay, it is the greateſt delight to what God hath in himſelf, his Son, and Spirit, and Angels, the letting out of himſelf to the ſouls of men (thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved:) And on the other ſide, it muſt needs bee an infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the ſoul alwayes to bee letting out it ſelf upon God, as now, what delight do men take in eating and drinking? now if there bee ſuch delight from the humour in the palat meeting with a peece of meat in the mouth, becauſe of the ſuitableneſs between one object and another? Oh what delight muſt there needs bee when this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal precious ſoul being inlarged to the uttermoſt with all exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ency ſhall then meet with an infinite God, the infinite firſt-being of all things as the moſt ſuitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it, and ſo bee letting of its ſelf forth to God,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168883:125"/> and God letting of himſelf forth to it again.</p>
                     <p>Again, the good that the ſoul is capable of with God, it is to have an union with God, for the ſoul to be made one with God, to be united ſo as to be made one with him: <hi>Hee that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and ſaith Chriſt, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe that thou haſt given mee, may bee one with mee, as thou and I are one.</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things do moſt unite one to another; there may bee a thouſand beams of the Sun united, and almoſt into one point, becauſe it is of a more ſpiritual nature: ſo when the ſoul ſhall bee made one Spirit with God, it being a Spirit, and God likewiſe a Spirit, there will bee an exact union one with another: And ſo the more ſpiritual things are, the more they communicate one to another; as in nature, the more corporeal a thing is, the leſs it communicates its ſelf; the earth doth not communicate its ſelf with any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the water communicates its ſelf more than that, and the air more than that, and the fire more than that; the Sun, that is leſs corporeal than any of theſe elements that wee have here, and therefore that communicates its ſelf more than the element doth: Now God being a Spirit, and the ſouls of men ſpiritual, Oh what a communion will there bee of each to other!</p>
                     <p>And then further, the ſoul is capable of fruition of God; union, and communion, and fruition, what is that you will ſay? that is to have God not onely to bee united to it, but to have a kind of poſſeſſion of him, to have the uſe of all that there is in God that can make mee happy, to have the full uſe of it when I will; then a man doth injoy a thing, when hee can have the uſe of ſuch a thing when hee will: Now the ſouls of the Saints ſhall enjoy God, that is, ſhall have the uſe of all that glory and good there is in God that can make them happy, when they will, &amp; ſhall have as much uſe of God as they will; ſurely they muſt needs bee happy that ſhall thus enjoy God: If a man had the fruition of the world, that hee could have the uſe of all the good things in the world, when hee would, you would think him happy;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:168883:126"/> but this is the happineſs of the ſouls of the Saints, that they ſhall have ſuch a fruition of God, that they ſhall have all the uſe of God that they will, and when they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll.</p>
                     <p>And further, Fruition hath this in it, it hath a reflect act; A man, though hee hath a great deal of riches given him, yet if hee doth not know this, or if ſo bee that hee doth know it, and yet have not the comfort of it, hee doth not enjoy it; ſuch a man, though hee bee born to a great deal, yet if hee have not the reflect act to know that hee hath it, hee doth not enjoy it: So wee enjoy but little of God now, becauſe God, though hee bee the portion of a gracious heart, yet the heart doth not know this fully: But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when it ſhall bee perfect, then the ſoul ſhall perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what good there is in God, and how far my ſoul may and is happy in the enjoyment of this God; I ſhall know how to make uſe of God to the full, and ſhall have continually the comfort of all that good there is in God.</p>
                     <p>And yet further, the preſence and communion with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that the ſoul ſhall have, beſides that of God the Father, it ſhall bee with him, where hee is: It is a bleſſed thing here <hi>to follow the Lamb whitherſoever hee goes,</hi> but to bee alwaies with him, to have alwaies fruition of him, and to have communion likewiſe with all the Saints and Angels, and all the bleſſed ſpirits, that is a bleſſed thing indeed. I remember I have read of <hi>Cato,</hi> when hee was about to dye, <hi>Oh bleſſed day,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>for now I ſhall go to the ſouls of wiſe men, and Philoſophers;</hi> and ſo upon that ground he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the day of his death a bleſſed day, becauſe hee ſhould go to have communion with the ſouls of Philoſophers and wiſe men: But how bleſſed is it then for our ſouls to have communion eternally with Angels and bleſſed ſpirits? <hi>You are come to an innumerable company of Angels,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.22, 23</note> 
                        <hi>and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> When a ſoul is converted, it comes to have ſome kind of communion with innumerable company of Angels, and with the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect: It hath the aſſurance of it here, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:168883:126"/> ſhall have the enjoyment fully and perfectly hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>And then the continual exerciſe that the ſoul ſhall bee buſied in, to bee for ever bleſſing, and magnifying, and praiſing and worſhipping of God, and receiving in from God, and letting out its ſelf to God: The eternal Sabbath that it ſhall keep, and then the eternal reſt that the ſoul ſhall have, when it comes to God, it comes there to its Center, there it hath perfect peace and reſt, and can never have trouble further.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and it ſhall live in God; not onely God live in it, but it ſhall, I ſay, live in God, as (though the ſimilitude comes ſhort of it) the fiſh ſwimming in the Sea; ſo the ſoul ſhall bee ſwimming in the infinite Ocean of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the great God. It is ſaid of <hi>John,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 1.10. Col. 3.3</note> that hee was <hi>in the Spirit on the Lords day;</hi> ſo the ſoul ſhall live in God: <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> But our life ſhall bee plain and apparent, not hidden, but apparent before Angels, and all the reſt of the bleſſed, and ſo our lives ſhall bee after another manner than now they are. Now to open every one of theſe things would bee very large, ſo that it ſuffices now onely to preſent them to you, to ſhew in a ſhort view the good of the ſoul in the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, and what it ſhall have from him, that ſo you may ſee what the loſs of the ſoul means. Now if theſe things bee true and real, Oh what a dreadful thing is it for a man to loſe his ſoul, for a man to come to loſe all this good, that others that have ſouls like unto him ſhall come to enjoy, and that hee might have enjoyed as well as others! If there were no more in the loſs of the ſoul but this, to bee caſt away from the good that it is capable of, it might ſhew unto us this loſs to bee very dreadful. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin</hi> long ſince ſpeaking of that place where <hi>Dives</hi> did deſire <hi>Lazarus</hi> to come with one drop of water to cool his tormented tongue, ſaith hee, If there ſhould bee but one drop of heavenly felicity let into Hell, it would quench all the fire of Hell preſently: And <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:168883:127"/> hath ſuch an expreſſion, that hee would rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thouſands of years in pain and torment in Hell, than hee would loſe that good that hee might have in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; hee accounted <hi>paena damni,</hi> the loſs of God to bee the greater, and it were a good ſign of a ſoul that did underſtand its own excellency, and what good it were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, to fear as well the loſs of God, and what good it might have in God, and to account that as great an evil to it, as pain, and horrour, and torment: Why, when wee come to expreſs the wrath of God to you, and the evil that ſin deſerves, we ſpeak of Hell fire, and ſo the Scripture doth; If wee would ſet out the great evil of puniſhment (when wee ſpeak to men and women that are lead by ſenſe) wee would tell them of their bodies being thouſands of years in ſcalding Lead, and kept alive there, and this would ſtartle and amaze them; but certainly the evil of the ſouls rejection from God, and being caſt off from the good that there is in God, it is as great, if not a greater evil; and a good ſign, I ſay it were, that God is going to ſhew what our ſouls are to us and the true excellency of them; If wee begin to bee affected with the loſs of God himſelf, and the good wee might have in God, not onely afraid of Hell, becauſe of fire and torment there, but afraid of having our ſouls loſt, becauſe of being deprived of ſuch infinite good, as otherwiſe wee might come to enjoy with God: A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart hath more thought about loſing the good that there is in God, than of the pain that hee ſhould feel in Hell.</p>
                     <p>To ſet it out a little but in this reſemblance, of the eye being deprived of light: An eye that hath beheld the glory of the Heavens, and of the Creatures, though it ſhould never have any pain, but onely there ſhould bee ſuch an ill humour, ſo as to take away all light from it; why what hurt is here to the eye? it is but onely the abſence of a good thing, the eye feels no pain; but what man in the world but would rather bee willing to have his eyes to ſee, and not to bee blinde all his life time, than to have the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:168883:127"/> of thouſands of gold and ſilver? Now if the bare ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſight of a mans eyes bee ſo great an evil, and hee would rather almoſt endure any pain, than to have his eyes deprived of the light, then certainly the abſence of God muſt needs bee a moſt dreadful evil to the ſoul: when the Sun ſhines in its luſtre, how beautiful is it?<note place="margin">☜</note> and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to that it is at midnight, when it is diſmal dark? why what is done? it is onely the abſence of one Creature, one Creature is here now, and ſhines gloriouſly upon us, and at midnight the Creature is gone: ſo what a mighty change and alteration would there bee in the ſoul, if it ſhould bee deprived of the preſence of the Lord? if the Lord who is infinite in glory bee preſent with the ſoul, and ſhine upon it to all eternity, Oh how glorious will it bee but Gods withdrawing himſelf, fully and everlaſtingly from the ſoul, Oh what a diſmal night of darkneſs will there bee! and therefore it is a moſt dreadful thing for the ſoul of a man to bee loſt in regard of this firſt particular, in regard of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that good that it is capable of.</p>

                     <p>As every ſoul here by nature is deprived of all that good in which it was created, and ſecondly, as it doth wander from, and is at enmity againſt God: ſo when the ſoul is loſt eternally, then it is perfectly againſt God, and doth hate and blaſpheme God for ever: Thou that art a wicked man, thou wilt ſin, but when God hath caſt thee away from
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:168883:128"/> him eternally, then, as I may ſay, thou ſhalt have thy belly full of ſin, thou then ſhalt bee fully given up unto ſin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.11. <hi>And they blaſphemed the God of Heaven, becauſe of their pains and ſorrows:</hi> Now that is ſpoken of the beaſt, of Antichriſt; but if men here blaſpheme God becauſe of pains, what ſhall they do that are damned in Hell? they that ſhall have the vials of Gods wrath poured out upon them? But you will ask, how doth it appear that for the wicked to bee given up to ſin is ſuch an evil unto them, whereas here it is their delight to commit ſin? To which I anſwer, though they love ſin, and though ſin bee their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light here, yet hereafter, when they are caſt off from God for ever, then they ſhall not finde that delight in ſin, as now they do: as to give you it in an example, put a fiſh into a pot of water, and the fiſh doth ſwim, and play, and delight therein, becauſe it is the proper element of the fiſh to bee in the water; but now, if you do but put fire under that pot of water wherein the fiſh doth play and take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, why then that which was before the delight and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fiſh, thereby becomes its pain and torture: ſo, though ſin in this life is delightful unto wicked men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is their proper element to bee in ſin in this life, yet hereafter ſin ſhall bee their pain, becauſe then there ſhall bee mixt with it the wrath of God, which will make it pain and torture. Again, the loſs of the ſoul conſiſts in this, when the ſoul is fully poſſeſſed of all the evils that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the good it is capable of: Thus ſhall it be with the loſt ſoul eternally:</p>
                     <p>That as the Saints ſhall bee inlarged and made more capable of good, which they ſhall enjoy to all eternity: ſo, thoſe that are wicked and loſt ſouls, which ſhall bee oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to God, ſhall bee inlarged in their capacities, and bee poſſeſſed, and made capable of all contrary evils.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To bee caſt under the eternal curſe of God, I ſay, to bee eternally under the curſe of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To have all the faculties of the ſoul to bee

Brethren, the ſoul of man, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large veſſel, and becauſe wee know but little of the large extent of our ſouls, therefore it is that wee are ſo little ſenſible of the loſs of them, or of the pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are capable of, or liable unto: But as the ſoul is larger than the body to take in comfort; ſo is it larger than the body likewiſe to take in pain, miſery, and wrath: we ſhould bee ſenſible of ſuch an expreſſion as this; to have the body in all the members of it to bee filled with fire, ſo as to bee all on a hot fiery burning coale, and that to all eternity; this you would think could not but bee an extreme miſery: But the ſouls capacity is far larger than the bodies: And to have the ſoul filled in every faculty of it with the wrath of God, it is far greater pain, than to have the body in ſuch a condition, which is the condition of a loſt ſoul. Further, it doth conſiſt in having the power of God ſtretched forth to bring evil and wrath upon it, and that to the utmoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endureth with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted unto deſtruction?</hi> (As thus)</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The infinite power of God put forth in enlarging their natures, that they may bee the more capable of evil.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The infinite power of God put forth to uphold their natures, that they bee not ſunk down with thoſe dreadful evils that God hath to put upon them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The infinite power of God to let out upon the ſoul, what ever it can bear to make it miſerable, ſo as not to bee annihilated therewith, which it ſhall bear for ever. And
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:168883:129"/> further, A loſt ſoul is in this condition alſo, to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under the ſtroak of Gods juſtice, that when it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h lain under its pains thouſands of thouſands of years, ſaith divine Juſtice, I am not yet ſatisfied. Now that that is required, is, that the ſoul ſhould lye under the wrath of God, until ſuch time that God may have as much honour by puniſhing it, as hee hath had diſhonour by its ſinning againſt him, and that muſt bee for ever; becauſe God can never have ſo much honour by the puniſhing of it, as hee hath had diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by its ſinning againſt him: (And then) As the ſoul ſhould have had eternal communion with God and Chriſt, &amp;c. it being loſt, it muſt have communion inſtead thereof with the Devil and the damned ſpirits in Hell: And if this bee the condition of a loſt ſoul in Hell, as it is, then what ſhall a man gain in gaining the world, if hee loſe his ſoul? But further, to make this miſery appear to bee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery indeed, There is required a perfect ſenſe of all theſe evils: for a man or woman may bee in a loſt condition, as many are now, but they do not underſtand it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not ſenſible of it.</p>
                     <p>But that ſoul that is loſt eternally, the Lord ſhall ſo far enlighten its underſtanding, as may make it ſenſible of all its evil; certainly many this day are in ſuch a condition, as did they but underſtand the loſt condition they are in, it would make them tremble: But now, when the ſoul is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally loſt, it ſhall then perfectly underſtand what its loſt condition is, and then the thoughts of its mind ſhall bee ſo buſied about its miſery, as that it ſhall not bee able to eaſe its ſelf one moment, but its thoughts ſhall be buſied about its condition, ſo far as may make it miſerable; And the Lord is able to make a creature as ſenſible of miſery as hee pleaſeth. For this is the propriety of God, to make a creature as ſenſible of all the evil that is upon him as hee pleaſeth; and if ſo, then when all theſe evils come upon the creature, and the Lord intends to make the creature fully ſenſible of it; then certainly it muſt needs bee miſerable indeed. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then this loſs of the ſoul conſiſts in this, That it muſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168883:130"/> have nothing to ſupport it, when the burden of the wrath of the infinite God ſhall bee thus upon it; (as alſo) there ſhall bee no mixture of any good to bring relief or eaſe, nor any intermiſſion of time; it muſt not bee one moment of time out of this condition of miſery, but muſt bee in it continually to all eternity.</p>
                     <p>Further, In this doth its miſery conſiſt, becauſe God will keep all the faculties of the loſt ſoul in their utmoſt activity, whereas now it is not ſo with us; for if miſery and pain bee upon us here, after a while our activity and ſenſibleneſs of it is partly gone: But the Lord will make ſuch ſouls as are eternally loſt, as perfectly ſenſible of this its miſery every moment, as ever it was the very firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it went into that miſery. Then</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, In regard of the irrecoverableneſs of the loſtneſs of the ſoul when it is once loſt.</p>
                     <p>The ſoul, when it is departed from the body, and once loſt, then all the power of God can never help nor reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it; but then the ſtream of Gods wrath ſhall carry it with that mighty force, as that it ſhall not bee able to all eternity to have the leaſt actings of its ſelf towards its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance for ever.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There ſhall bee no Mediatour between God and the loſt ſoul, none to mediate for it: Now, had not wee a Mediatour between God and us, wee were all certainly loſt; but now for the ſoul that is once loſt eternally, Jeſus Chriſt will never tender up any work of mediation for ſuch a ſoul; that is certainly gone and loſt irrecoverably. And then further, the gates of mercy will bee for ever ſhut againſt ſuch a ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Now for the further opening and ſetting forth the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the loſs of the ſoul, there are divers aggravations wherein the miſery of it doth further appear.</p>
                     <p>The firſt aggravation is this, If the ſoul bee thus loſt, then the body is, and will be loſt alſo: It will bring the body into the very ſame loſt condition of miſery that it is in its ſelf, ſo far as it is capable of miſery; and that upon theſe two grounds.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe the body all the time a man doth live in this world, it was the onely or moſt immediate inſtrument that the ſoul had to work and to ſin by: And certainly God muſt needs hate that body, and curſe it, that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſoul, becauſe it was the onely inſtrument of the ſoul to ſin by.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Miſerable muſt the body alſo bee, becauſe when ſuch a loſt ſoul ſhall bee united unto the body, the very extremity of the ſoul muſt needs bring miſery upon the body alſo; as thus, When Chriſt had the apprehenſions of his Fathers wrath and diſpleaſure in his ſoul, how did it work upon his body even ſo as to cauſe even clodders of blood to fall from him? Now, what cauſed this pain in his body, but the terrors of God in his ſoul? and if it was ſo with Jeſus Chriſt, that had but ſin imputed unto him, then certainly the body of a damned creature muſt needs bee in very great and dreadful torment, to which this ſoul is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If a holy man cried out, <hi>Thy arrows ſtick faſt in mee,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.2.3</note> 
                        <hi>and thy hand preſſeth mee ſore, there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger, neither is there any rest in my bones, becauſe of my ſin.</hi> I ſay, if the anger of God cauſed this miſery unto <hi>Davids</hi> body for his ſin, what miſery will that bee when all the faculties of the ſoul ſhall bee filled with the wrath of God to their utmoſt capacity? O then, I ſay, what dreadful evil and pain will there bee unto the body united unto ſuch a ſoul!</p>
                     <p>The ſecond aggravation of the loſs of the ſoul, it is this, That when it comes to bee in this loſt condition, then it comes to bee in the deadfulleſt and moſt miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that any Creature is in, except the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Scripture tells us, it is an evil thing to have <hi>riches kept for a mans hurt:</hi> But O then what an evil is it, and will it bee, for a man to have an immortal ſoul for <hi>his hurt?</hi> this is the condition of a loſt ſoul.</p>
                     <p>The third aggravation of the loſs of the ſoul, is this, It will have none to pitty it, in that its miſerable loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is in.</p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:168883:131"/>
                     <p>If a man in this world ſhould loſe his eſtate, or any great loſs, hee would have many to pitty him: if a man loſe by fire, then hee may obtain a gathering, whereby his loſs may bee partly made up, or hee relieved; or if you loſe your children, you have your friends to pitty you, and to condole with you: But that man that ſhall have his ſoul loſt, hee ſhall bee in ſuch a condition, as that hee ſhall have none to pitty him.</p>
                     <p>True, wee are all loſt by nature, but in that our loſt condition wee have God pittying us, and Chriſt pittying us, and the Angels looking upon us with pitty, and Saints pittying us; But hereafter, if loſt, none ſhall pitty that ſoul in that condition, when its loſs is eternal. God ſhall not pitty it, but then the bleſſed God ſhall look upon it as an object of his eternal curſe: But no pitty ſhall hee have of ſouls in that their loſt condition; neither ſhall Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt pitty them: True, Jeſus Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave thoſe that were naturally loſt, but yee have done what in you lay to fruſtrate the ends of Chriſt his coming: and as Chriſt ſhall not pitty you, ſo mercy it ſelf ſhall not pitty you; but bee ſo far from pittying of you, as that it ſhall plead againſt you</p>
                     <p>And Angels they ſhall not pitty you, becauſe they ſhall bee taken up in bleſſing and praiſing of God for his works, and righteous judgements upon you:</p>
                     <p>Neither ſhall the Saints pitty you, though it bee thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of whoſe loins thou cameſt; or though it bee thy Mother, out of whoſe womb thou cameſt; yet they ſhall not pitty thee, though thou art loſt, and loſt eternally, but ſhall rejoyce at it, and bleſs God for his juſtice upon thee: therefore miſerable is the condition of a loſt ſoul.</p>
                     <p>The fourth aggravation of a loſt ſoul, is this, It will prove unto moſt that are loſt, an unexpected loſs: There are very few that have any apprehenſions of the loſs of their ſouls, but they think they may go on in ſin, and yet do well enough.</p>
                     <p>It may bee thou heareſt a Miniſter ſpeak of the loſs of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:168883:131"/> ſoul, but thou flattereſt thy ſelf, and thinkeſt thou ſhalt do well enough; but at length, before thou art aware, thy ſoul may bee loſt, and that unexpectedly; then it muſt needs bee dreadful, becauſe it is ſo great and unexpected: As (for example) if a Merchant ſhould hear that his ſtock at the Indies were there ſafe and well, and afterward upon an inſtant there doth come news unexpectedly that all is loſt and gone, Oh how doth it damp him! and O conſider how it will damp thee hereafter, though now thou doſt flatter thy ſelf, If thy ſoul ſhould bee loſt eternally? I ſay, it will bee a dreadful loſs in regard of the unexpectedneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>A fifth aggravation is this, It will prove to bee a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful loſs, becauſe the loſs of every ſoul that ſhall bee loſt, will prove to bee a wilful loſs: This is a great perplexity to a man in this world, when as hee doth ſee hee is undone, and that meerly through his own wilfulneſs; and this will bee the aggravation of the ſouls loſs, that one day it ſhall plainly appear unto them, that it was through their own wilfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yee will not come to mee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">John 5.40.</note> 
                        <hi>that you might have life;</hi> and yee will not indure to hear of the danger yee are in, of being loſt eternally: Oh how wilful muſt the loſs of thoſe ſouls bee, that will not give ear to hear of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their ſouls are in, of being thus loſt? And O how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do you run on in wicked courſes, which God hath given command unto the contrary in his Word, and how do you wilfully caſt off the means that God hath appointed for your ſalvation? But know, yee periſh wilfully, if yee wilfully reject or neglect to improve the means that God hath given for the ſaving of your ſouls: I ſay, that man or woman that ſhall wilfully caſt off thoſe truths of God that ſhould ſave them, that man or woman doth wilfully periſh:</p>
                     <p>Well, but you will ſay, you do not ſin wilfully, but you are overtaken with ſin. To which I anſwer, that the ſin which a man doth do, which outward carnal motives
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:168883:132"/> would bee a prevailing means to him to perſwade him not to do; yet all that is in Gods Word given to perſwade to the contrary, doth not; hee ſins wilfully, and if hee periſh, hee will bee found to periſh wilfully.</p>
                     <p>It may bee you will further ſay, you are ignorant, and therefore if wee did know better, wee would do better; I anſwer, yet it is wilful, becauſe you are wilfully igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and therefore your loſs is wilful.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth aggravation of the loſs of the ſoul, it is this, becauſe the eternal loſs of the ſoul will bee a great loſs for a little matter.</p>
                     <p>For a man to venture the loſs of his ſoul for the gaining of a Kingdome, hee would think it ſomething, but yet the Text tells us hee would bee a great loſer; but if ſo great a loſer to gain a Kingdome for his ſoul, O then how great an evil will it bee for a man or woman to loſe their ſouls for trifles! You do not got the world for your ſouls, but perhaps you do venture the loſs of your ſouls for the getting of a groat, or ſixpence, or twopence, or it may bee upon the fear of the diſpleaſure, or anger of your Maſter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; you will venture the loſs of your ſouls in telling a lye to excuſe you, or it may bee for the ſatisfying of a baſe luſt one quarter of an hour, thou wilt venture the eternal loſs of a precious ſoul, more worth than ten thouſand worlds.</p>
                     <p>Did you never go into the place where condemned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were, and ask them what they are there for? why, it may bee ſome of them will ſay but for a ſmall matter, it may bee the undue gaining of two or three ſhillings, and now my life muſt go for it: So many loſe their ſouls, even for trifles, for nothing, for a baſe luſt, which is worſe than nothing; the conſideration of which will make it the more dreadful.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The loſs of the ſoul will bee very dreadful upon this conſideration, becauſe many will loſe their ſouls, that are very nigh to the ſaving of their ſouls: I ſay, the nearer a man or woman doth come to the ſaving their ſouls, and yet loſe them; the loſs of the ſoul upon that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:168883:132"/> will bee the more dreadful to them; and it is thus with many that have many good workings in and upon their hearts, ſo that they are in a very good forwardneſs unto the everlaſting ſalvation of their ſouls, and yet there doth come ſome luſt that doth drive them back again: The loſs of the ſouls of hypocrites therefore will bee dreadful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider: I that was in ſo fair a way to ſalvation in the uſe of means, and content to leave ſo many evil waies, and yet that I ſhould have one that I would not leave, and for this have I loſt my ſoul; I that was contented to take up ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties, and yet by my hearts embracing of one ſinful luſt, to loſe my ſoul; as <hi>Herod heard John Baptiſt gladly, and hee reformed many things,</hi> and yet hee had one ſin that hee would not part withall: Thoſe that are the neareſt the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſouls, and yet loſt at laſt, this will bee a great aggravation of the miſery thereof.</p>
                     <p>An eighth aggravation of the loſs of the ſoul, is this, The conſideration that they have loſt their ſouls, and that ſo, as that they have nothing in lieu of them; they ſhall not onely loſe their ſouls, but they ſhall even loſe the thing for which they did venture the loſs of their ſouls: As for example, if a man ſhould have his heart ſo ſet upon a trifle, as to loſe his whole eſtate for it, and after hee hath loſt his eſtate for it, hee ſhould loſe that thing for which hee loſt his eſtate too; this would aggravate the loſs of his eſtate much more: Juſt ſo, if you do loſs your ſouls for the world, or for pleaſure; if your ſouls periſh, I ſay yee ſhall both loſe your ſouls, and that thing, bee it what it will, for which you ventured and loſt your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>And thou ſhalt have no more pleaſure nor I content than thoſe that did not venture the loſs of their ſouls for it.</p>
                     <p>The ninth aggravation of the loſs of the ſoul, is, The ſhame that ſhall bee put upon thoſe ſouls that ſhall be loſt, that periſh eternally: As when thy acquaintance, thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that dwelt next unto thee, that knew thee, that dwelt in the family with thee, that kept daies of faſt with thee, and went unto the meetings with thee, when they ſhall bee thoſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:168883:133"/> that ſhall be with God for ever eternally bleſſing &amp; praiſing of him, and ſhall point thee out, as with the finger, before God, the Angels, and bleſſed Saints, and ſay, Behold, this is hee that was an hypocrite, that ſate under the ſame word, and that did partake of the ſame means and ordinances as I did,<note place="margin">Pſal 52 7.</note> and yet hee hath loſt his ſoul: <hi>Loe this is the man that made not God his stay.</hi> So all they that periſh ſhall ſtand before men and Angels, and bee pointed at by them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Loe this is the man, and loe this is the woman, that made not God their ſtrength, but did ſo love their ſin, as that they would not by any means bee perſwaded to part with it, but would rather venture the loſs of their ſouls, to injoy their ſins, and fulfil their luſt, than part with their ſins to ſave their ſouls.</p>
                     <p>The tenth aggravation of the miſery of a loſt ſoul, is this, When they ſhall ſee others taken up into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, who were as unlikely to bee ſaved as themſelves, and they themſelves ſhut out, and eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt: It may bee thou that art a carnal Maſter mayſt ſee thy poor ſervant taken up to God, and thou thy ſelf ſhut out; or it may bee the carnal Father or Mother may ſee their childe ſaved, and yet they themſelves loſt; Oh this will bee a ſad aggravation of their loſs. And thus you have heard the dreadful loſs of the ſoul, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the aggravations thereof in theſe ten particulars. Now for the Uſe.</p>
                     <p>Is it ſo, that the loſs of the ſoul eternally is ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a loſs, as you have heard it is? Oh then let every one here bleſs God for their ſouls, that their ſouls are not thus loſt. It might have been ſo long ere this time; when ſuch a kinſman of thine dyed, or thy fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or when ſuch a neighbour or acquaintance of thine dyed, if thou hadſt but dyed when they dyed, thy ſoul, it may bee, had been eternally loſt.</p>
                     <p>This I can aſſure you, that naturally you are all loſt, and what makes the difference between thy ſoul, and the condition of a loſt ſoul, as you have heard,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:168883:133"/> but onely the meer mercy of God? Oh therefore now bleſs God for his mercy unto thee, that thy ſoul is not as yet a loſt ſoul, and think thus with thy ſelf, Lord, if theſe things bee true, and ſo dreadful to hear of, Oh then what would be my miſery if it ſhould prove that I ſhould bee the perſon made ſenſible thereof, by experiencing the miſery I hear of, to bee the miſerable condition of a loſt ſoul?</p>
                     <p>The Scripture doth ſay concerning the joy and happineſs of the Saints, <hi>That eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> 
                        <hi>neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive what their happineſs ſhall bee, that ſhall bee ſaved.</hi> And the like may bee ſaid of the miſery of the ſouls that are eternally loſt; and the Scripture doth ſay, <hi>That if our Goſpel bee hid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3.</note> 
                        <hi>it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi> I beſeech you therefore remember what hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning the condition of lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t ſouls, and lay to heart what hath been ſpoken out of this Text, leſt within a little time you feel what hath been ſpoken to bee a truth, and ſo bee forced to cry out, True it is, I heard ſuch a day out of ſuch a text, what was the miſerable condition of a ſoul eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt, but now I finde it by experience to bee true, and the one half I now feel, I could not then conceive: And know the reaſon, my Brethren, why we lay the miſery of loſt ſouls thus before you, it is to this end, that none of you might be thus loſt: And it is a bleſſed thing for you to hear theſe things; for how many are there that have loſt their ſouls, which till they were thus loſt, never ſo much as heard any thing about the loſs of their ſouls, which if they had, who knows what might have been done by them for the ſaving of their ſouls? Beloved, ſuch a ſubject as this cannot be ſpoken unto you without trembling; for certainly this ſubject will bee much adding to the prevention of the loſs, or elſe it will mightily aggravate the loſs of your ſouls, if ever they are eternally loſt; therefore all I have at preſent to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel you to, is, to lay theſe things to your hearts ſeriouſly, as alſo to bleſs God for your ſouls, that as yet they are not in this dreadful eternally loſt condition.</p>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:168883:134"/> So it ſhould bee here, whatever wee loſe, wee are to bee comforted in this, that our ſouls are not gone and loſt: It is a notable Scripture, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt. <hi>Wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ſouls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, you are like to meet with great ſufferings, you may likely bee deprived of all you have, of your eſtates, and of all your comforts, and may come to ſuffer much, yet commit the keeping of your ſouls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator: Why, they might have ſaid, but what ſhall become of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things? if ſtorms, and tempeſts, and ſufferings come, what ſhall become of our eſtates? what ſhall become of our livelihoods, and of our bodies? why ſaith the Apoſtle, as for them, for your eſtates, for your bodies, it may bee they may periſh; you are not ſo much to look after them, but commit the keeping of your ſouls unto him, as unto a faithful Creator. The Apoſtle here exhorts them what to do in times of ſufferings, and by what hee doth expreſs, hee doth imply, that they ſhould take no care for outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and body; it is enough that your ſouls are well, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the keeping of your ſouls to him, as unto a faithful Creator, wee have enough if that bee ſafe: You know in time of danger, as fires, and other times, if a man hath any precious thing, hee carries that preſently to ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al friend, and commits the keeping of that to him; his writings and ſuch things, wherein his eſtate is moſt: So ſaith the Apoſtle, in the time of publick danger, Take care to commit the keeping of your ſouls to him, as unto a faithful Creator, and you are well enough. That is the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the loſs of the ſoul bee ſo dreadful a loſs, Oh let us bleſs God then for Jeſus Chriſt, without whom all our ſouls had been eternally loſt, never a ſoul in the world but muſt have periſhed unto all eternity, had not Jeſus Chriſt come into the world to bee the great Saviour of ſouls; All the Angels in Heaven, and men in the world could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:168883:135"/> have ſaved one ſoul; now Chriſt ſaw this, and his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els did even yearn towards ſo many thouſands of precious ſouls, and rather than they ſhould periſh, hee was content to come and make his own ſoul to bee an offering for ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. the ſoul of Chriſt was made an offering there, and what was that but for the ſaving of ſouls? wee may therefore, concerning Chriſt, well ſay, as the Elders, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>They ſang a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy, &amp;c. for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood.</hi> Oh thou art worthy! O bleſſed Saviour! Hee doth not ſay what, but onely thus, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof, for thou wert ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God: There is infinite worthineſs in Chriſt, and worthy hee is of all the honour that wee are able poſſibly to bring to him, had wee ten thouſand times more ſtrength than wee have to do it; <hi>For hee was ſlain, and hath redeemed us to God by his blood.</hi> If there were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor people upon the Sea, and in danger to be loſt, their own ſhip through ſtreſs of weather fallen to peeces, and they upon a plank, and ready to bee ſwallowed up of every wave, and there comes a ſhip by, and ſaves their lives, Oh how would they bee affected with ſuch a mercy as this! and bleſs God for his goodneſs, that ſuch a ſhip ſhould come by at ſuch a time; wee had all been loſt if this ſhip had not come by juſt at this time: So when wee read the Goſpel, wee read of Jeſus Chriſt God-Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, and ſtanding between the wrath of the Infinite God, and ſinful ſouls, let us then conſider how infinitely wee are bound to bleſs God for Jeſus Chriſt; for we were ready even all of us to bee ſwallowed up into the bottomleſs gulf of the wrath of the infinite God; the waves of Gods infinite wrath, were ready to have covered over all man-kinde, onely the Lord Jeſus Chriſt comes, and even leaps, as it were, into the very Ocean of Gods wrath, into the very flames of the wrath and juſtice of God, to pluck out our ſouls, and to ſave them: Bleſs wee God then for Jeſus Chriſt, conſidering that the loſs of ſouls is ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:168883:135"/> loſs, and onely ſaved by that great Saviour that is come into the world.</p>
                     <p>And then thirdly, If the loſs of the ſoul bee ſo dreadful, then it muſt needs bee a dreadful evil for any to have any hand in this loſs, or to bee any furtherance of it: Take heed that thou haſt no hand at all in ſo great an evil as this is; Oh how much better thou hadſt never been born, than to have a hand in ſo great an evil! wee account thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creatures, that have a hand in the loſs of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; to have a hand in the undoing of one ſoul is a greater miſchief, than to be the cauſe of the undoing of a whole Kingdome for their outward eſtate: If one ſhould bee the cauſe of the ruine of a whole Kingdome for their outward eſtate, you would ſay that certainly it had been better that that man had never been born: Certainly thou that haſt a hand in the undoing of any ſoul, thou wert born to do a greater miſchief than ſuch a one; if any friend of yours take a courſe whereby hee undoes himſelf, and when the evil conſequence of his unwiſe courſes appears, you are ready to ſay, Bleſſed bee God I had no hand in it. If peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will damn their ſouls eternally, take heed you have no hand in it; and if any of your children, friends, ſervants, acquaintance, neighbours, ſhould periſh eternally, yet it will bee a great mercy if you have no hand in it: People may have a hand in the loſs of other mens ſouls many waies.</p>
                     <p>As by careleſneſs of the ſouls of thoſe committed to their charge; they may come to bee loſt by thy careleſneſs; by thy neglect their ſouls may periſh; and eſpecially it concerns thoſe that take the charge of ſouls, they had need look to it, that thoſe do not cry out againſt them in Hell, that it was through their neglect that they are here now, and muſt lye here for ever? Oh the cry of a ſoul againſt a man is a dreadful thing! perhaps the ſouls of ſome of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may bee in Hell, crying out againſt you for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them, that you regarded them not, you let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Sabbaths, you could hear them ſwear, and rebuke
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:168883:136"/> them not, or but very ſlightly; you never inſtructed them in the waies of God, and eternal life: you were the cauſe of the deſtruction of their ſouls, by your wicked example; they ſaw their Parents do thus and thus, hate goodneſs and good men; they ſaw them ſcorn at the Word, or neglect it, and contemn it, and upon that they did ſo too, and now they are in Hell for it, and curſing the time that ever they were born of ſuch Parents: And many ſouls, no queſtion there are in Hell, curſing the time that ever they came into ſuch a wicked family, wherein they ſaw ſo much wickedneſs, wherein there was no worſhipping of God, nor no means to come to know God, and upon that they went on ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in wickedneſs, and now are ſunk down to eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. — You may bee the cauſe of the deſtruction of others ſouls, by drawing of them to ſin; when you ſhall be active to draw any one to the commiſſion of any ſin, thou doſt what in thee lieſt to caſt away that precious immortal ſoul; And have never any of you had a hand in this? have you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been inſtruments to draw others to ſome ſin or other? now if you have, either theſe that you have tempted are yet alive, or they are dead; if they bee alive, know, that you are bound in conſcience to do now to the uttermoſt for the good of their ſouls; to make it your great work, if it bee poſſible, to do them as much good as ever you did them hurt; for certainly <hi>Soul</hi>-ſatisfaction is required of men, as well as <hi>Bodily</hi>-ſatisfaction: If you have wronged a man in his eſtate any way, although it were ſeven, twenty years ago, if God comes to awaken your conſciences, it will not ſerve your turn to return and repent, that is, to bee very ſorry that you have done it, and ask God forgiveneſs, but before you can have peace, you muſt make ſatisfaction where you have wronged, if God inable you: Now, doth God ſtand ſo much upon that, that if one hath but wronged a man in his eſtate, that all the ſorrow and repenting in the world will never bring peace of conſcience, without reſtitution, where there is ability? then certainly, if one hath wronged another in his ſoul, and hath indangered the damnation of that, by
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:168883:136"/> drawing of him to ſin: It is not enough for thee that thou ſeeſt this thy ſin, and thou art ſorry for it, and thou wilt never ſeek to draw others any more, no, but thou art bound, if ſuch bee alive, to go to them if thou canſt, and to ſeek now to do them as much good for their ſouls, as thou wert a cauſe of evil; what if this ſoul ſhould periſh at laſt by this ſin, that thou wert a cauſe to draw them to, thou hadſt need look about thee while they live, that if it bee poſſible thou mayeſt make a ſatisfaction for that ſoul-wrong that thou haſt done to them; and it may bee ſuch a one is dead, and ſo dead, as for ought thou knoweſt hee never did repent him of that ſin; now then ſee what a caſe thou art in: there is one drawn to a ſin by thee, and now hee is in Hell for that ſin that thou wert the cauſe of; what a caſe haſt thou brought thy ſelf into now? Is it any otherwiſe like, but that thou muſt follow? ſhall one bee in Hell for a ſin that thou wert the cauſe of, and doſt thou think alwaies to eſcape? here is the dreadful eſtate that any man brings himſelf to, when hee draws others to ſin: thou hadſt need to look about thee, and thy heart to bee affected with that ſin that hath been puniſhed with the eternal damnation of thoſe ſouls that thou haſt drawn to that ſin.— And not onely by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſin, but by incouraging to ſin, by diſſwading from that that is good: It may bee ſome ſouls have been in a good forwardneſs to that which is good, they have begun to inquire after the waies of God, but have gotten into thy company, and thou haſt ſought to take them off; and what, will you bee ſuch fools as to beleeve every thing that is ſaid, and you will bee melancholly and mad, and who are they but a company of ſimple people that do thus and thus? and thus thou haſt been a means to hinder the good work of God in others, and to draw them from the good way that they were a beginning to ſet their feet in, and now they begin to bee out of love with the good waies of God, and thou haſt been the cauſe of it: Now, if theſe ſouls periſh, and it may bee ſome of them are in Hell already; truly, if a mans heart we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>4</label> If the loſs of a ſoul bee ſo dreadful, then hence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the folly and madneſs of moſt people that have no care of their ſouls, but through their own wretchedneſs and vileneſs they ſuffer their ſouls to periſh eternally; all their care is in pampering their bodies, and making much of them, but little minding their ſouls, and their eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: Certainly when the bodies of thoſe ſouls ſhall meet them at the day of judgement, it will bee a very dreadful meeting: When thine immortal ſoul ſhall know what it is to bee loſt for ever, and ſhall bee brought to joyn again with the body, Oh how do you think it will look upon that curſed carkaſs? Oh this is that carkaſs, that body of mine, for whoſe ſake I muſt periſh for ever, yea and wee muſt now bee joyned both together, to bee fuel for the wrath of the Infinite God to burn upon to all eternity! certainly ſouls are loſt, and periſh thick and threefold, they go down to Hell, as Bees flie to the hive in the time of a ſtorm: There are many waies by which the ſoul may bee loſt, though there bee but one by which it may bee ſaved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſeveral waies by which men come to loſe their Souls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As firſt, Some there are that loſe their ſouls by wandring up and down in darkneſs all the daies of their lives, by
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:168883:137"/> wandring in the waies of ſin, in the dark, and ſo are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual prey unto the Devil: how many, yea and in many places, the generality of people, they go on continually in blindneſs and darkneſs, in the vanity of their converſations, knowing nothing of God, nor of their own ſouls; and the firſt time that the eyes of their ſouls are opened and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is when they are irrecoverably undone; yea the firſt thing that many ſouls do ever underſtand concerning themſelves, it is this, I am loſt and undone for ever; it is ſo with many, certainly they know nothing about their own ſouls, nor about God, till they come to know this, I am caſt away from God, and have loſt my ſoul for ever.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Others, they loſe their ſouls by pawning of them away; by pawning of them, what is that you will ſay? why, you know what it is to pawn a thing, when you come and receive from a Broker ſuch a thing, you lay ſomething elſe to pawn for it, and upon this condition, that within ſuch a time you bring them ſuch a thing that you bargain for, and if you do not bring it againſt that time, then you loſe your pawn: Thus many pawn away their ſouls; when there is a temptation to any ſin, and they have a mind to it, now upon the commiſſion of this ſin thou doſt lay thy ſoul to pawn to the Devil, onely upon this condition, that if thou doſt repent and beleeve before God cuts thee off, then thou ſhalt have thy ſoul again; upon theſe tearms moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſin, and in caſe thou doſt not bring repentance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef in Chriſt, thy ſoul is gone: I appeal to you, there is a temptation to ſin, you know it is a ſin, and there is a great deal of danger in it, well but you have a mind to it, and you will needs have it, now you will acknowledge this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if I do not repent, then I ſhall bee damned, but before I die, I hope to repent, and ſo I hope that my ſoul ſhall not periſh; that is as much as to ſay, I will lay my ſoul in pawn, and if I can bring repentance before I die, I will have my ſoul again, but if I do not, then my ſoul is gone; thus upon the commiſſion of every ſin, thou doſt lay thy ſoul to pawn, the devil hath it upon ſuch tearms as theſe: Now how many
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:168883:138"/> thouſands have loſt this their pawn, they have not brought Faith and Repentance within their time before they died, and ſo the Devil hath kept the pawn, and will keep it for ever: And it is more dangerous the laying of ſuch a pawn, than the ordinary laying of pawns to Brokers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is no ſuch pawn that poſſibly can bee laid as this, the ſoul of a man: Men and women that have any wiſdome, they will not lay pawns of thoſe things that are precious to them, Oh it goes to their hearts to think, what muſt I lay this to pawn! I thought I ſhould never have lived to the day to lay ſuch a thing to pawn, I but when thou comeſt to lay thy ſoul to pawn, thou layeſt a more precious thing than all the world is.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When thou layeſt a thing to pawn, thou doſt prefix thy own time for the redeeming of it again, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps two, three, four months before thou bring that, that is bargained for; but when thou layeſt thy ſoul to pawn, thou canſt not ſet any time:<note place="margin">Luk. 12.20</note> 
                        <hi>What doſt thou know, oh Fool, but that this night thy ſoul may bee taken away from thee?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Yea and further, When you lay ſuch a thing to pawn, you make a bargain for the bringing of ſomewhat to redeem it that you have in your own power, or make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that you ſhall have in your own power to bring, you will not make the bargain to bring ſuch a thing that you are ſure you ſhall not have in your own power: Now, when you lay your ſouls to pawn, you lay them to pawn for that that you have not in your power, nor all the creatures in Heaven and Earth cannot help you to in your need, and that is <hi>Faith and Repentance:</hi> All the Angels in Heaven, nor men in the world cannot help you to it; it is onely in the hands of God, of the Infinite bleſſed God, againſt whom you ſin, and whom you provoke, and yet how many do thus pawn their ſouls? and no marvel though men loſe their fouls, becauſe they pawn them thus fooliſhly and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that is the ſecond way of mens loſing of their ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Men loſe their ſouls by wounding them, they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:168883:138"/> give them deadly wounds, upon which the ſouls of moſt do periſh.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Wounding, how you will ſay?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By that I mean the commiſſion of ſins againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; to commit a known ſin, and a wilful ſin, oh this gives a wide gaſh in the ſoul, a moſt fearful wound! every ſin againſt conſcience gives a wound that requires a ſalve to heal it, that is more worth than a thouſand worlds; the ſins againſt conſcience, againſt light, againſt knowledge, they are deep wounds unto the ſouls of men; and it is not uſual for ſuch wounds to bee healed, for they do not onely ſtrike at the life of the ſoul, but they harden the heart of the ſinner exceedingly, and keep off the means that might do the ſoul good; thou goeſt abroad into company, and there thou committeſt a ſin againſt thy conſcience, oh thou haſt given a gaſh to that precious ſoul of thine, thou haſt given it a deep wound, and except thou lookeſt to it, and that preſently, thy ſoul perhaps may die for ever! A man that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a deep wound, hee preſently ſends for the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and if it bleeds well, hee hopes the cure is more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: ſo when thou haſt committed ſin, if indeed it bleed, that is, if thy ſoul preſently bee ſenſible of it, and affected with it, and mourn and lament, and ſo ſeek after the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, there may bee hopes; but men and women do wound their own ſouls by wilful ſins, ſins againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and yet they are not ſenſible of them, they do not ſo much as bleed, but they lye in the very open Air, as it were, and are not bound up at all, Ah! thouſand thouſands there are that die and periſh this way.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, And then a fourth ſort there are that loſe their ſouls by being gulled of them, by being deceived of them; Satan perſwades them they are in a good condition, that all is well with them, and they need not fear, what need they to trouble themſelves, theſe are but the melancholly thoughts of ſuch and ſuch kind of people; there is no ſuch great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters required in ſorrow for ſin, and it is but a Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon us, and but, a being in Chriſt, and hoping in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:168883:139"/> Gods mercy, and the like; and thus by ſuch kind of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe are, many ſouls are gulled and deceived by the Devil, and ſo periſh for ever. They are like unto <hi>Jonas,</hi> that was aſleep, and awakened in the midſt of a dreadful tempeſt: ſo certainly theſe ſouls, when they come to know themſelves, and to bee awakened, it will bee in the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tempeſt of Gods wrath: As <hi>Sampſon; the Philiſtims are upon thee,</hi> when hee lay in <hi>Delilahs</hi> boſome; ſo there will bee that dreadful noiſe one day to theſe ſouls, the wrath of God, and the curſe of the Law is upon thee, that muſt lye upon thee; Oh the dreadful ſorrow there will bee when the ſoul ſhall ſee, oh I am deluded and gulled! ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you are vext extreamly, when you are gulled of any little part of your eſtates, but to bee deluded and gulled of your ſouls, ſo as they muſt bee loſt for ever, this will bee extream horrour another day.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A fifth way of loſing our ſouls, is, by ſelling of them away; ſelling of them away, you will ſay, what do I mean by that? It is ſaid of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, that was Pope, hee ſold his ſoul to the Devil for the Popedome, there was an expreſs contract between the Devil and him, that if in ſuch a year hee ſhould come to bee Pope, the Devil ſhould have his ſoul: But now, there is a twofold ſelling of our ſouls to the Devil, beſides ſuch a kind of contract, as when the Devil ſhall appear in a bodily ſhape, and ſo people ſell their ſouls to him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As firſt, When men ſeek advantage to themſelves by any unlawful means, ſeek the gain of the world, or any profits or pleaſures, by cheating, couzening, wronging, ſwearing, or forſwearing; ſeek I ſay to gain any thing in ſuch a way; there is ſuch a thing that thou wouldeſt have, and that thou mayeſt have, if thou wilt bee falſe in thy books, in thy reckonings, or forſwear thy ſelf for gain, I ſay thou doſt as truly ſell thy ſoul for the getting of that gain, as ever Conjurer did, that did contract face to face with the Devil: I would have ſuch a gain, why, ſaith the Devil, (though thou doſt not ſee him) then thou muſt lye, thou
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:168883:139"/> muſt couzen, thou muſt ſwear, and forſwear, I will do it, ſaith the ſoul; and thus thou doſt many times ſell thy ſoul to the Devil: You that are chap-men, if one ſhould come and offer you a little matter for a commodity that is of price, you have ſuch a peece of ware in your ſhops that is worth forty ſhillings, and one comes and offers you t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o-pence for it, why you riſe in diſdain againſt it, what: offer mee two-pence for that which is worth forty ſhillings; oh now that your hearts would riſe in diſdain when the Devil comes to buy your ſouls! you ſhould riſe in diſdain, what, ſhall I venture the ſelling of this ſoul of mine, that is more worth than ten thouſand worlds, for ſuch a poor gain as this is? and yet many of you do.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, And then there is a ſecond way of a mans ſelling of his ſoul, and that is when a man ſhall reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give up himſelf to all manner of wickedneſs: Thus it is ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 21.20. <hi>Ahab ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs,</hi> that is, <hi>Ahab</hi> in a reſolute way was ſet upon any manner of wickedneſs that might ſerve his own turn: When a man ſhall bee ſet upon this, that what ever way of wickedneſs may bee ſubſervient to the attaining of ſuch and ſuch deſigns that I have, I will venture upon it, I ſay, this man ſells his ſoul in this caſe to the Devil, <hi>Ahab</hi> ſold himſelf to work wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, And then a ſixth way of mens loſing their ſouls, it is by being poiſoned, their ſouls are poiſoned, and ſo they come to bee loſt: now the poiſon of the ſoul it is either wicked company, or wicked errours; either of thoſe two.</p>
                     <p>By keeping of wicked company, thou keepeſt in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Air, thou goeſt from home ſometimes and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with ſuch wicked company, thou getteſt thy bain, thy poiſon there, and poiſon works divers waies; ſometimes it will cauſe one to ſwell mightily; how many, when they come from their wicked company, come home with ſuch
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:168883:140"/> ſwelling hearts, in ſuch an outragious way, ſwearing, and fighting, and blaſpheming, and ſcorning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning at all waies of godlineſs; now theſe have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and have gotten poiſon, and ſo they ſhall, and are ready to burſt with it.</p>
                     <p>Now there are other kinds of poiſon that will not work till a quarter or half a year after: A man may go into company, and get his bain, and yet not work till a quarter of a year after: As I remember a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſeeing two women that were wicked, talk together, Oh! ſaith hee, now the Viper is taking of poiſon from the Aſp, and indeed it ſeemed to bee a Proverb in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> time, for I meet with ſuch a proverbial ſpeech in him, as that the Viper borrows poiſon from the Aſp: ſo when wicked company are infuſing wicked principles, here is the poiſon gotten from the Aſp; wicked company perhaps they come with their ſweet cups, and perhaps thou drinkeſt down the Wine merrily, but together with the Wine, wicked things are infuſed into thy ſpirit that are poiſonful: When thou art in wicked company, and heareſt the waies of God ſpoken againſt, and heareſt the Saints of God railed on, and the good Word of God ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt, and this thou draweſt into thy heart, oh there is poiſon goes down in this cup; it is like to poiſon thy ſoul, and to be thy undoing for ever.</p>
                     <p>And then there is another kind of venome, and that is wicked errours and hereſies, when men drink off the <hi>Cup of Fornication,</hi> as when they are taken with the great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Popery, this poiſons the ſoul; that place in the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> is a moſt dreadful place, even for that very errour, 2 <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 2.11. Speaking of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that hee <hi>ſhould come with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might bee ſaved; and for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeve a lye, that they all might bee damned who beleeve not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> This is a moſt
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:168883:140"/> dreadful Text againſt thoſe that ſhall drink in the errours of Popery.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, that they are learned men, and have a great deal of ſhew of truth, with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs: But how art thou deceived by them? becauſe thou receiveſt not the love of the truth, that thou mighteſt bee ſaved: And for <hi>this cauſe</hi> God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions to beleeve a lye, that they might bee damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to that end God ſends ſtrong deluſions, that men might beleeve thoſe errours, and drink in that cup of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, that they might bee damned for ever.</p>
                     <p>If it were but onely that one errour drunk down in the groſneſs of it, that is, that the righteouſneſs that I muſt tender up to God for ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice, and for my eternal ſalvation, muſt bee mine own righteouſneſs, mine own works: Here is enough to poiſon a ſoul to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition; and many other waies there may bee that may indanger the ſoul extreamly, and very ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may bee gathered from good principles: As for that principle of our Juſtification by free Grace in Chriſt; That it is onely by Chriſt that wee are juſtified, that principle is exceeding good, but from thence ſuch dangerous venomous conſequences may bee drawn, as may extreamly indanger; and I make no queſtion do invenome and poiſon many thouſand ſouls, upon which they draw conſequences for looſeneſs, and againſt humiliation for ſin, and againſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, as by <hi>Moſes.</hi> All the principles and errours that are againſt the ſtrict waies of God, that tend to any looſeneſs, certainly they are invenoming principles: Oh take heed of any doctrine, of any conceits, of any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that do any way tend to looſeneſs! they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly poiſon and invenome your ſouls, ſo that your very errours may bee enough to damn you eternally. Many loſe their ſouls by poiſoning.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, And there are many that loſe their ſouls by venturing of them; there are many ventures upon which many come to loſe their ſouls; there are four caſes
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:168883:141"/> wherein a man may loſe his ſoul by venturing of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As firſt by raſhneſſe, men that are inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and raſh in their waies, that will ſuddenly fall upon things before they examine them, that raſhneſſe and ſuddenneſſe of thine to fall upon things before thou doſt examine them, and to go on in a raſh way the moſt part of thy life, as many do; this indangers the loſs of thy ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, And others venture the loſſe of their ſouls, by doing things that are doubtful, that their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences miſ-give them in, and tell them, Oh this is not right, I doubt I ſin againſt God in this, and yet they will put on and venture, before they ſatisfie their doubts, but take heed of doing any thing with a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſcience, for you know what the Scripture ſaith, in the 14. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the latter end; <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is ſin.</hi> If thou doubteſt, thou muſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do a thing, till thou haſt examined thy doubt, and there ſee upon what ground thy doubt is built, for if thou wilt preſume to do a thing doubtfully, it may coſt thee thy life.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A third venture, it is to venture upon Gods patience; why, the Lord is a patient God, and hee hath ſpared mee ſo many years; all this while I have been ſpared, and have done well enough, why may not I hope that God will ſpare mee ſtill, and bee patient with mee ſtill? how many wretched ſinful creatures venture upon this? they perhaps have been brought up in wickedneſſe and prophaneneſſe; God hath been pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient towards them, and yet they can to their ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, and live very merry lives: Now all this time thou liveſt upon the meer patience of God, and thou thinkeſt becauſe God hath been patient thus long, therefore hee will bee ſo ſtill: Wee may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed venture upon the Grace of God in his Son, as well for ſanctification as for pardon, but not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:168883:141"/> either upon patience, or any thing elſe, ſo as to continue in our ſins, though God hath been patient thus long, thou doſt not know but that upon thy next ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the cord of mercy may crack, and thou mayeſt ſink and periſh eternally; that may befall thee in one day, that hath not befallen thee all thy life before; take heed my brethren of venturing upon patience, for that hath not a word of promiſe to ſtrengthen it unto thee: Indeed Faith is a kind of venture, but that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon the Word of God, and the Promiſe of God, and it is good venturing upon that, but when thou ventureſt upon patience, thou haſt no word to aſſure thee that patience will hold; Thou haſt no word to make this good unto thee, that though God hath been patient ſo many years, therefore hee will bee ſo ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, And then a fourth venture that men make, it is to venture upon their own lives; they are young, and they hope they may live many years yet, I know others they live to bee old men, and why may not I live and have my pleaſure as well as they? and thus they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Oh but what if the threed of thy life ſhould bee ſnapt aſunder, what will become of thee then! wilt thou venture thy eternal miſcarrying upon ſuch a brittle and frail thing as thy life is? Oh it is a deſperate ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when men and women will venture thus! that if God take away my life now, certainly I muſt periſh for ever. — Now I put it unto every ſoul in this place, let this bee the caſe now, do you examine what you think in your conſciences your conditions would bee, if you ſhould hear a voice from Heaven ſaying unto you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, this ſoul ſhall have no more time to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for eternity; I am perſwaded that in ſuch a place as this is there cannot but bee many that would in their own conſciences ſay, If God ſhould take away my life now, I fear I ſhould bee loſt for ever; I doubt, if wee could go from one to another, and lay our ears to the boſoms of men, and could but hear what the conſciences
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:168883:142"/> of men ſay upon this that is now put to them, that thou ſhouldeſt dye in the condition in which now thou art, and what repentance thou haſt had, bee it good or bad, that thy ſoul muſt depend upon, if it bee not right, thy ſoul muſt periſh; I ſay, I fear that upon ſuch a meſſage from Heaven, many a mans and womans heart would ask within them, and their conſciences would tell them, I am afraid I ſhould bee loſt for ever: Oh for thee to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to bee in ſuch a condition any one moment, that if thou ſhouldeſt dye that moment, thy ſoul ſhould bee damned, I ſay thou art a bold and preſumptuous ſinner, a moſt deſperate wretch.</p>

I put this to your conſciences, anſwer it as in the preſence of God; if this ſhould bee put to you, can you ſay as in Gods preſence that ſees and ſearches the hearts of men, that upon the real ſweetneſs and good your ſouls have found in the Word, that if God ſhould put it to your choice, either to live with bread and water, and have the Word, or to live with all the delicacies in the world without the Word, you would a thouſand thouſand times ſooner chuſe to live with the Word with bread and water, rather than without the Word

                     <p>Ninthly, In the ninth place there is another ſort that loſe their ſouls by ſurfeiting of them; their ſouls do ſurfeit with the cares and pleaſures of this life, they glut their hearts with the delights, and pleaſures, and cares of this world, until their ſouls get a ſurfeit and die of them; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty unto their hearts to delight themſelves in all outward contentments, eſpecially if they bee lawful: Now a man or woman may ſurfeit their ſouls,<note place="margin">Licitis perimus omnes.</note> and undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by lawful things; as a man may not onely deſtroy his life by eating poiſon, but by a ſurfeit of good meat, though the meat bee good, yet hee may ſurfeit upon it: ſo, though the things of this world, the cares, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures may bee (as ſome things are) in themſelves lawful, yet by an inordinate and immoderate letting out thy heart to lawful things, thou mayeſt ſurfeit thy ſoul, and it may die of that ſurfeit: Many men think themſelves out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if the things that their hearts are upon, bee in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful, they are not ſwearers, and whoremaſters, and drunkards, and theeves, as others are, and therefore they think their ſouls may bee ſaved: I ſay, thou mayeſt buſie thy heart onely about that which is in its ſelf lawful, and yet thy ſoul may take a ſurfeit and periſh eternally.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly and laſtly; Many loſe their ſouls by forfeiting them, and that by theſe two waies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A man forfeits his ſoul, as men do their Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, by not tendering that homage to their Lord that is due, by which they hold their Lands, and ſo their Lands come to bee forfeit; ſo doſt thou; God hath given thee thy precious ſoul, more worth than all the world, and thou holdeſt it of God, but ſo as thou muſt tender up to this Lord that homage that is due to him, that is, thou muſt worſhip God: When wee come to worſhip God, this is that wee do, wee come to tender up that homage that wee acknowledge to bee due to God for theſe ſouls
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:168883:144"/> of ours that hee hath given unto us, that is our worſhip; that is the nature of worſhip, The tendering up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of homage, to acknowledge that due reſpect wee owe unto God, as that Lord that hath the abſolute diſpoſe of us; now by neglect of worſhipping of God, of tendering up his homage, thou forfeiteſt thy ſoul, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangereſt thy ſelf to periſh eternally; and oh how few people regard any ſuch worſhip of God! and though they do the thing that God requires, as praying, and coming to hear the Word, yet do they not do it as in a way of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering up homage to that God, upon whom they do onely depend; but now this is that which God requires of us, or otherwiſe our ſouls are forfeited.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Men forfeit their ſouls by breaking covenant with God; however there may bee ſome that God will not take the forfeiture of, yet certainly upon thy breach of covenant with God thy ſoul is forfeited: Thou doſt ingage thy ſoul to God every time thou doſt enter into covenant with him; It may bee ſaid of any man or woman that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into covenant with God, who is this that hath ingaged his ſoul to God? now thou ingaging and binding thy ſoul to God in thy covenant, upon thy breach of it, dealing falſely, thou doſt forfeit thy ſoul: And by theſe ſeveral waies ſouls are loſt; and oh how many thouſand ſouls periſh with ſuch waies and manners as theſe are! and therefore ſeeing there are ſuch ſeveral waies of the loſs of ſouls, let not people think themſelves ſafe, though they do not go in ſome waies whereby they may come to loſe their ſouls; for there are very many waies whereby thou mayeſt loſe thy ſoul, and ſo miſcarry to eternity.</p>

                        </label> The other Uſe that remains, is this, If the loſs of our ſouls bee ſo dreadful a thing, and there bee ſo many waies for the loſing of them, then it concerns us neerly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether wee bee not in ſuch a condition for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that if our ſouls ſhould depart out of our bodies, they would certainly bee loſt; this is a needful ſcrutiny, and a moſt neceſſary inquiry: Many men have theſe thoughts,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:168883:144"/> what if I ſhould now die? I have not made my Will, and my eſtate would go ſuch and ſuch waies, as I would not have it, it would bee ſquandered away, it would bee ſpent in Sutes of Law; I, but rather let thy thoughts run out thus, what if I ſhould now die, would not my ſoul bee loſt and periſh for ever? Now, though I have ſaid wee cannot ſet forth ſuch a man or woman, and conclude that their ſouls ſhall certainly bee loſt, becauſe wee know not what God may do hereafter, but wee may ſay this, that ſuch a man or womans ſoul in the condition it is, If God do no more for it than hee hath yet done, that then it will certainly bee loſt: Indeed a man or woman may come to know, and certainly to conclude that they are elected, but none can come to ſuch a concluſion, to know certainly that they are Reprobates: the vileſt wretch that is upon the face of the earth, hee hath not ground ſufficient to conclude againſt himſelf that hee is a Reprobate, and that his ſoul ſhall for ever bee loſt; and therefore ſurely wee cannot conclude againſt another, if not againſt our ſelves. — Well, but who are they, that if God ſhould work no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon them than hee hath done, that then their ſouls would bee loſt?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In the firſt place, That ſoul to whom God hath not made known, and convinc'd it of the dangerous natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition in which it is, if ſuch a ſoul ſhould depart from the body, it would bee loſt. — Onely let mee premiſe theſe two cautions; I do not ſpeak of Infants, but of thoſe that are come to years, and that live under means: — And I ſpeak of Gods ordinary way; wee will not limit God, what hee may do in extraordinary waies, but in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe and way of Gods dealings with the children of men, that hee lets live to come to years, and bee under means, theſe following rules will diſcover who they are that at the preſent are in a loſt condition; I ſay, ſuch to whom God hath never revealed and convinced them of the evil of their natural condition, in which they were born, in which they are, if God ſhould let them ſo die, and make
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:168883:145"/> known no more to them than hee hath, ſuch a ſoul would bee loſt, and that upon this ground, becauſe that without Faith it muſt bee loſt, that is acknowledged by all; hee that beleeves not ſhall bee damned, is condemned already. Now, there cannot bee Faith in a Saviour to ſave the ſoul, but it muſt needs imply that I know what a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am in by ſin. For there is even a contradiction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in my beleeving in Chriſt, as a Saviour, and yet I not convinced of the damnable condition that I am in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That ſoul that yet hath not made it to bee its great care, above all outward things in this world, to ſave its ſelf, that ſoul, if it ſhould now depart from the body, would bee loſt: I ſay, if God hath not firſt convinc'd thee, and made thee ſenſible of that damnable condition in which thou art in thy ſelf, and ſecondly, if hee hath not taken off thy heart from the creature, from the things that are here below, and made it to bee the great care of thy ſoul, for to get it to bee ſaved, hath not made thee to bee ſolicitous about the work of ſaving of thy ſoul; ſuch a ſoul as this is, I ſay, if it ſhould now depart, would bee loſt, for God doth not ſave ſouls, but by manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note> hee would have all <hi>to work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Certainly, though the principle of our ſalvation bee without us, yet the Lord that made us without our ſelves, will never ſave us without our ſelves; whoſoever God doth ſave, hee doth make them ſolicitous and careful about the work of the ſalvation of their ſouls: Now, if thy conſcience tells thee that to this day thy care hath been about many vanities, but as for having thy heart taken up with the ſaving thy ſoul, thou knoweſt not what belongs to this; I ſay, if God ſhould work no more in thee, than hee hath done, if thou ſhouldeſt now die, thou wouldeſt bee loſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That ſoul to whom the Lord hath not revealed the glory of the myſteries of the Goſpel, that yet hath the Goſpel <hi>kept hidden</hi> from it, that doth not ſee into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:168883:145"/> work of God in the covenant of Grace, in thoſe great counſels of God, and great things that God hath done for the ſalvation of mankind in Jeſus Chriſt, that ſoul would bee loſt, if it ſhould now go from the body, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work of God upon it: That Scripture that divers times you have heard named, is proof ſufficient for it; <hi>If our Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel bee hidden, it is hidden to thoſe that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3. Now certainly, my brethren, if God hath revealed to your ſouls the glorious things of the Goſpel, they cannot but bee taking things to you, they cannot but cauſe much ſtirring, much activeneſs, mighty workings in your ſouls: when once the glorious light of the Goſpel comes into a ſoul, I ſay, it cannot but cauſe mighty ſtirrings and workings in ſuch a ſoul. When I ſee people ſit deadly and dully under the means of Grace, under the preaching of the glorious things of the Goſpel, I cannot but think with my ſelf, Lord, do theſe people know what Jeſus Chriſt is? and underſtand what the great things are that God hath done for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man-kind? certainly did they but know the wonderful and ſtrange works of God about the ſalvation of the ſouls of the children of men, their hearts could not but ſtir within them, and work in another manner than yet they have done.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That ſoul that hath no other righteouſneſs to tender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>p unto God but its own righteouſneſs, if now it ſhould depart, would bee loſt eternally: Whatever man or woman it bee that have lived the moſt unblameable in his life and converſation, that hath been the moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that no man could bee able to blame him for any thing, yet I ſay, if this man or woman hath no other righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to tender up unto God but his own, certainly this ſoul would bee a loſt ſoul for ever; the truth is, even the ſoul of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſouls of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, all of them would bee loſt eternally, had they no other righteouſneſs to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up to God but their own, much more thoſe who have only a Civil righteouſneſs, and a meer natural righteouſneſs,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:168883:146"/> ſuch righteouſneſs as is attainable by the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch a righteouſneſs as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks on, in the 3. of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that hee lived unblameably, how hee was a Phariſee, and hee accounted that righteouſneſs of his converſation, to bee <hi>gain,</hi> yet afterwards, when Chriſt was revealed to him, hee accounted it <hi>but loſs,</hi> for hee ſaw that it would endanger the loſs of his ſoul eternally, the reſting upon that.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay, the ſoul that hath no other righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but his own to tender up to God, is that ſoul loſt? why, what other righteouſneſs is there beſides that which is a mans own?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, There is a ſupernatural righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the righteouſneſs of a Mediatour, God-Man, that is come into the world to ſtand between loſt ſouls, and an infinite provoked God; and that is made over to the ſoul by Faith, and that ſoul that is ſaved, by the hand of Faith, doth tender up the righteouſneſs of that Mediatour, God-Man, for the ſatisfaction of infinite divine Juſtice, and the appeaſing of infinite wrath, and that is the ſoul that is ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but that ſoul that is not acquainted with ſuch a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that hath not ſuch a righteouſneſs made over to it by Faith, the righteouſneſs of the Son of God, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that is by Faith in Chriſt, that ſoul, if it ſhould now depart from the body, and the Lord work no otherwiſe upon it, than hee hath yet done, certainly hee would bee a loſt ſoul; and that is the fourth evidence of a ſoul that would preſently bee loſt, if it ſhould now depart from the body.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A fifth evidence is this, That ſoul that God hath not made (in ſome meaſure at leaſt) to feel the weight and burden of ſin, diſcovered ſin unto it as a greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den than all burdens whatſoever, if ſuch a ſoul ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, it would prove to bee loſt, and that upon this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe without repentance a ſoul muſt needs bee loſt, <hi>Except yee repent,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk 13.3.</note> 
                        <hi>yee ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:168883:146"/> Now repentance cannot ſtand with feeling ſin light, much leſs with joy in ſin: Repentance, whether before Faith or after, wee will not now ſpeak of, whether a Legal repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or an Evangelical repentance, yet it muſt bee ſuch a repentance as muſt bee apprehenſive and ſenſible of ſin, as a greater evil than all the evils that it is liable to here in the world; It muſt feel ſin, as it is againſt God, feel ſin, as ſin, ſo as to bee a burden to it (the meaſure of it, how far, and how weighty ſin ſhould bee, wee do not now ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but that ſin ſhould bee found a great burden, yea an intollerable burden, ſo that were it not for an infinite Mediatour, the ſoul could not ſtand under the burden, that is neceſſary in the work of repentance, and ſo the ſoul to come to ſorrow for ſin, as ſin; and this is the repentance which is unto life, which cannot bee except the ſoul doth feel in ſome meaſure the weight and burden of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Again, that man or woman that walks after the fleſh, in a courſe of ſin, to give ſatisfaction and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the fleſh, that makes it to bee the great care and indeavour of it for to ſatisfie the fleſh, ſuch of you, whoſe conſciences tell you, that the contentment of your hearts is ſome fleſhly thing, and that in the courſe of your lives you walk after the fleſh, certainly if you ſhould now die, your ſouls would bee loſt; and that is clear out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that do not walk after the ſpirit, but after the fleſh, there is condemnation unto them at the preſent; O! if men had but enlightened and ſtirring conſciences, how eaſie would it bee for men and women to ſee themſelves in a reſtleſs condition, and to conclude, that if theſe things be the truths of God, then I am in ſuch a condition, and though I do not know what God may work for time to come, yet if I ſhould now die, my ſoul would bee loſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; and ſo that other place, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>They that live after the fleſh ſhall die;</hi> that is, periſh eternally; if your hearts bee after the fleſh, after fleſhly things, and they are the

It is your great care that the fleſh bee ſatisfied, and it is Gods threat, that when you make it thus your great care to ſatisfie the fleſh, that you ſhall die, ſo that this is a periſhing condition unto you.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Yea further, what ſoul ſoever is but under the dominion of any one luſt, that ſoul, if it ſhould now depart, would certainly bee loſt: Not onely ſuch as live in all kind of ſins, that the conſtant courſe of their lives is in every kind of ſin; but if there bee but any one reigning, ruling ſin, if there bee but any one ſinful way that God hath convinc'd thy conſcience of to bee a ſin, and yet becauſe of gain, or delight, or pleaſure, or honours, or reſpects, thou doſt go on in a conſtant courſe, and way, and practice of that ſin, though it bee but one ſin, ſo that thou art a ſlave to any one luſt, certainly this ſoul of thine, if God works no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwiſe upon it, than yet hee hath done, will certainly be loſt; and that is clear out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> I would reaſon from this Scripture, thus, what ſoul ſoever is not under grace, under the covenant of grace, and under the mercy that there is in that covenant, that ſoul, if now it ſhould depart, muſt periſh eternally; but whoſoever is under the dominion of any one ſin, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace; for the Scripture plainly ſaith, That ſin ſhall not have dominion over us, if wee bee under grace: If our ſouls bee in ſuch an eſtate, as they bee under the grace of the Goſpel, then there muſt not any one ſin have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:168883:147"/> them; there may ſome ſin dwell there, but not reign there: there is a great deal of difference between ſins being in the ſoul, and ruling over the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>You will ſay then, What is it for ſin to have dominion?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> When ſin ſhall ſet up a kind of Throne in the ſoul, and give Laws as a King, and thou ſhalt obey: It is one thing for an enemy to come with violence and take poſſeſſion, and hurry one on to do that one would not do, and another thing to bee ſubject, and to yeeld to the laws and commandements of ſin. Now ſin hath dominion when it is as a King upon his Throne, that thou ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ldeſt ſubjection unto it, and for the ſatisfying of thine own luſts, thou art willing that this ſin ſhould rule over thee: Now that you may know a little further for the meaning of this; ſin and Jeſus Chriſt cannot have dominion both together: Then thus far wee may go ſafely, that except Jeſus Chriſt hath dominion over you, then ſin hath: But how ſhall I know whether Chriſt hath dominion? I will but appeal to you in this plain and familiar kinde of expreſſing of my ſelf; canſt thou ſay as in the preſence of God that ſeeth and ſearcheſt thy heart, O Lord, thou knoweſt that I have given up my heart to the Rule of Jeſus Chriſt? I would put this to every ſoul here preſent, and I beſeech you weigh it, for wee are ſpeaking of matters of life and death, of ſalvation and damnation; now therefore I put this unto you, and think of it, canſt thou appeal to God in the ſincerity of thy heart, and ſay, Lord, thou art the ſeer and ſearcher of all hearts, and thou knoweſt, that though I have many weakneſſes and infirmities, and am often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by temptation, yet thou knoweſt that I have given up my heart to the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, and I do give it up, and it is that that my ſoul deſires above all things, that Jeſus Chriſt may rule in it, that Chriſt may have dominion, that his Laws may bee ſet up, and if I knew any more of the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, whatſoever it coſt mee, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt I would ſubmit unto it, and if there bee any thing that is againſt the mind of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:168883:148"/> if it bee but known to mee, thou knoweſt that my heart is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and I would rather than a world that I were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the power of it; canſt thou ſpeak thus as in the preſence of God? and certainly a Chriſtian, though a weak Chriſtian, can appeal to God in the ſincerity of it, and is able to venture its ſelf upon ſuch an appeal to God. And if there bee not this dominion of Jeſus Chriſt, then there is the dominion of ſin, and then thou art not under grace; therefore if God doth not more in thy ſoul than hee hath done, thou ſhalt periſh for ever; and that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that can ſleep quietly ſo, hath a ſtrange pillow to ſleep upon. It is reported of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> that hearing of a Gentleman that was much in debt, hee ſent to buy his pillow, ſaying, Surely there is a great deal of virtue in that pillow, that ſuch a man could ſleep on, who was ſo much in debt: Truly I may ſay ſo, it is a ſtrange kinde of pillow that men can ſleep upon, who are in ſuch a condition, that if God do no more for, than hee hath done, would certainly periſh.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, But further, That man or woman that hath not yet had ſuch a change wrought by the power of the Spirit of God, as is a new birth, a reſurrection from death, a new creation, that ſoul, if it now depart, would certainly periſh. Certainly every one of you, as you come into the world, as you are by nature, your ſouls are in a loſt eſtate, and in ſuch a loſt eſtate, as except the Lord make ſuch a change in your heart, as is a new birth, by which you come to bee born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; as is a new reſurrection, by which you come to bee raiſed from the dead; as is a new creation, by which you come to bee a new Creature; certainly you periſh; till this bee wrought in your hearts by the power of the Spirit, you are in a periſhing condition; there is nothing more plain than this in Scripture: You know what Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a man bee born again,</hi>

If ſo bee that your bodies had no other kind of ſoul than that that is of ſence, and afterwards a rational ſoul ſhould bee put into it, what a mighty change would there bee in that body? before they could onely ſee, and hear, and feel, but now having a rational ſoul, they can underſtand, underſtand reaſon, underſtand the waies of men; this is a mighty change; and truly, there is as mighty a change when God puts a new life into the ſoul, and doth regenerate it, making it partaker of the divine Nature, and even to come to live the life of God, according as the Scripture phraſe is: Now this muſt bee in every ſoul that muſt bee ſaved, and if the time bee not come, that this regeneration is wrought, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thy ſoul is yet in a periſhing condition, God knows onely what hee doth intend to do hereafter, but for the preſent, thy ſoul, I ſay, is in a periſhing condition: The firſt work that God made (that is, the work of Creation) by ſin was quite ſpoiled; Now Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, that is his honour and his work to rear up a new world, and that is a better world a great deal than the former world was; and the ſpecial creatures of this world they are his Saints, and the new Creation in their hearts; now this is the condition of a converted ſoul, it is made a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>All old things are done away.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note> Thou that liveſt in thine old waies, and art altogether for thine old cuſtomes, and what ſhalt thou do contrary now to what thy Fore-fathers did, and thou thy ſelf haſt done all thy life time? and the like; oh this is a dangerous kind of reaſoning! why, thou muſt bee <hi>a new Creature, and all things are to become new in thy ſoul;</hi> thou muſt know; that the Old Man is dead in thee, and that the New Creature is reared up in thee, or elſe thou canſt not know, that if thy ſoul ſhould this night

                     <p>Yea, Shall I yet ſay further, becauſe it is a point of a wonderful conſequence for men and vvomen to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it; I fear that there is many men and vvomen here, that yet all their lives time have not put this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to themſelves, What are the tearms betvveen God and mee? vvhy, I hope that God vvill vvork grace in mee; I but vvhat hath God done? is it ſo vvrought at this preſent, that if I were this moment to die, I were in a ſafe condition, and the hazard of my miſcarrying to all eternity were over?

                     <p>Secondly, They could not ſay thus, That they did prize Jeſus Chriſt for a Sanctifier, as well as a Saviour: None of them did look upon Jeſus Chriſt, that hee might deliver their ſouls from the power of their ſin, and work righteouſneſs in them, as well as deliver them from the wrath that is to come. Therefore though ſome of them would bee glad to bee ſaved from hell by Chriſt, yet to look upon Chriſt in regard of his purity and holineſs, as altogether lovely, this none of them could do.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and laſtly, None of them did lift up God as the higheſt end of all, and give up themſelves, and all that they had, or were, or could do, being empty of themſelves, ſo as to lift up God as revealed in Chriſt as the higheſt end, ſo as God and Chriſt to bee all in all to their ſouls; they went not thus far: And therefore do not think that it is a putting people to great ſtreights, to tell them how far ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny went, whoſe ſouls were loſt, and if they went no further, their ſouls would likewiſe bee eternally loſt. — Now then, theſe things being ſo, what remains, but that you ſhould lay them to your hearts?

Now therefore this is that that I would aim at, to turn the ſtrength of your ſouls into this great queſtion, <hi>What ſhall wee do to bee ſaved?</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 7. ſaith the wiſe man there, <hi>God hath made man upright, but hee hath found to himſelf many inventions,</hi> ſo your books have it, but I finde it tranſlated in the old Lattin, <hi>Hee hath mingled himſelf

And it concerns thoſe that yet have not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what condition their ſouls are in for ſalvation, to ask this queſtion ſpeedily, and not to put it off till they come to ſickneſs and death, and then ſend for Miniſters and godly Chriſtians, and ſay, Oh! what ſhall I do? how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon their ſick and death beds, that never minded to inquire before what they ſhould do to bee ſaved, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I am afraid my ſoul is loſt for ever, what ſhall I do? why doſt thou ask it now? is this queſtion to ask now when thy ſoul is going before the great and dreadful God to have the ſentence of its eternal doom to bee paſt upon it? Oh it concerns you betimes, you young ones, as ſoon as ever you come to know you have ſouls, it concerns you to bee asking this great queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do to bee ſaved?</hi> And wee have an example of this, of a young man that Chriſt lookt upon in love, becauſe hee was inquiſitive about the ſalvation of his ſoul; the ſtory is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Behold one came and ſaid unto him, Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal life,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. It appears that this was a young man; <hi>The young man ſaith unto him, All theſe things have I done.</hi> Oh it were a comely thing for young men to come to Chriſt, and ſay, What ſhall wee do to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life? and it appears that hee was a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a man of great poſſeſſions, and hee is called in the Goſpel by St. <hi>Luke, a Ruler;</hi> ſome Interpreters think that that was meant onely in the family, for the Jews had ſome chief in the family that did rule and govern there; but this young man hee comes to Chriſt, and that running,<note place="margin">Mark 10.17.</note> as in <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. where you have the ſtory, <hi>and Chriſt lookt upon him, and loved him,</hi> as in <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. Oh it is a lovely thing to ſee young people begin betimes to inquire what they ſhould
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:168883:152"/> do to bee ſaved, and wee have had great hopes of young people; but here is the policy of the Devil, when the Lord was bringing the greateſt harveſt of young people within this three or four years to himſelf, as ever was, I think, ſince the beginning of the world, and the Devil knowing that hee could not get them to turn to lewdneſs and prophaneneſs preſently again, therefore hee labours to put them upon turning all their Religion into queſtions about controverſal things, which they could not be able to mannage and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſo puts them off the thoughts of that great queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>What they ſhould do to bee ſaved?</hi> But O labour to inquire, and to bee ſatisfied and reſolved in that queſtion betimes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If you ask this queſtion, as you are to do it betimes, ſo do it earneſtly, do it with a great deal of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of ſpirit, as a matter of infinite concernment; ſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.17. <hi>When hee was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, good Maſter, what ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> Hee came running with a great deal of fervency and earneſtneſs about the buſineſs; and the fervency that youth hath ſhould bee manifeſted in this, in being earneſt in the inquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the way of ſalvation; people that are elder, they think they are well enough, and they have not lived ſo long, they think, as not to know how to bee ſaved all this while, and therefore will not enquire; ſo that their ſpirits do not boil with that fervency and heat as young ones do; hee came running to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If you do inquire, inquire ſincerely, with a heart truly willing to do whatſoever God ſhall make known to you; wee are this day about this great queſtion, what a man ſhould do to ſave his ſoul? I ſuppoſe many of you would bee glad to know what ſhould bee done, and mee-thinks every one is ready to ask ſuch a queſtion as this is: But before wee come to anſwer it, let mee ſpeak to you as in the Name of God, do you deſire to know it with a heart truly willing to yeeld to whatſoever ſhould out of Gods Word bee revealed to you? put this to your own hearts
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:168883:152"/> before wee come to give any anſwer, otherwiſe what do you hear this day, if there bee not ſuch a heart as this, that you can appeal to God, and profeſs that whatſoever this day the Lord ſhall reveal unto me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> from his Word that I ſhould do to ſave my ſoul, here I am, and profeſs to yeeld my ſelf up to the truths of God, if your hearts bee ſo fram'd, then wee may have incouragement to come and ſhew you what ſhould bee done.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, And you muſt inquire conſtantly too; if you ſhould not bee ſatisfied at one time, never bee at reſt till you are ſatisfied, do not ask what I ſhould do, and come to hear what you ſhould do, and then paſs it over, and let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little thing take this out of your minds again; but when you begin to bee inquiring after the way of ſalvation, reſolve that you will never give reſt to your ſouls, till you have gotten this queſtion anſwered to you. — And there is a great deal of reaſon that wee ſhould ask this queſtion in ſuch a way. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Firſt, Every one of your ſouls are in a loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition naturally; therefore it concerns you to bee inquiring after the way of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſalvation of a ſoul is the moſt difficult thing in the world; if ever thy ſoul bee ſaved, it muſt coſt more than Heaven and Earth is worth to ſave it; it is not therefore ſuch a trifling buſineſs, the ſaving of ſouls: This I dare avouch, as in the Name of God, that the ſoul of the pooreſt girl or ſervant that is here, if it bee ſaved, it muſt coſt more than Heaven and Earth is worth to ſave it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a difficulty in it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and laſtly, There are but few that ſhall bee ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there is nothing more clear in the Word of God than that, that there are but few ſouls that ſhall bee ſaved; wee cannot tell (as I have ſaid) that this or the other ſoul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſaved; wee are not to enter into Gods counſels concerning particular ſouls, but this wee may ſay,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.13. compared with Luk. 13.24.</note> and have warrant from the Word to ſay, that there are but few ſouls that ſhall bee ſaved: <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:168883:153"/> for ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way, and few there bee that enter:</hi> And upon that ground Chriſt himſelf raiſes that exhortation, therefore <hi>ſtrive;</hi> therefore inquire you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the way of ſalvation with all your might; if there ſhould a voice come from Heaven at this time, and ſay, there are but few in this Congregation ſhall go out alive, it would put every one to a ſtand; every one would think with himſelf, Oh Lord! muſt I die here? why there is this voice from Heaven, that there are but few ſouls in the world but ſhall periſh eternally; then certainly it is not for us to bee quiet, but it concerns us to bee reſtleſs in our conditions, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to ſay, what, <hi>is it I?</hi> what, <hi>is it I?</hi> when Chriſt did but ſay that one of you ſhall betray mee, every one was inquiring, <hi>Is it I? Is it I?</hi> but when it is ſaid that there ſhall bee but few ſaved; <hi>the flock of Chriſt is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flock,</hi> the words in the original are two diminutives, and may be tranſlated, <hi>a little little flock;</hi> Oh it concerns you all to look about you. But now theſe things being premiſed for the putting of you on to the enquiring after ſalvation with all your might: now wee come to the anſwer of this queſtion, What wee ſhould do that our ſouls may bee ſaved?</p>
                     <p>And in the anſwer to this wee muſt premiſe further.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is nothing that any man can do, that ſaves him, there muſt bee ſomewhat higher that what hee can do; and yet God requires that hee ſhould do what hee can do; Indeed what any man can do of himſelf, yea or by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from common grace, yea wee will ſay further, by aſſiſtance from any grace whatſoever, though it may help forward his ſalvation, by an ordinance of God, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the thing that ſaves him, the thing that ſaves him is higher than what is done by the creature, it is what is done by Chriſt, or what is ſuffered by Chriſt, it is that that ſaves the ſoul, and not, I ſay, what is done or ſuffered by us.</p>
                     <p>But yet now wee muſt not make ſuch a vain, and fooliſh, and dangerous inference, that therefore nothing is to bee done, becauſe the things that wee do are not the things that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:168883:153"/> ſave us; there is a great deal of evil comes from men and womens preſuming to draw conſequences; they think that if this bee true, the other will follow, and ſo through the weakneſs of their underſtandings,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.1. John 15.5.</note> they come to draw dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequences from true poſitions: Why, wee are dead in ſins by nature, and without mee yee can do nothing, ſaith Chriſt; upon this here is this conſequence drawn by many ignorant people that pervert the Word to their own deſtruction, If God bee not merciful to them; therefore why ſhould wee pray, or read, or hear, or uſe any means, let us lay aſide all, wee can do nothing, wee are dead in ſins, and the like: Now wee are to know, that though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee done by us (till God bring us into a ſtate of grace and ſalvation) that is acceptable, ſo as certainly ſhall bring us to Heaven, yet if it bee but that that ſhall ſtop us in the contrary way a little, it is worth our labour; If it be but that that any way may tend towards the bringing of us unto any means that may do us good, why it is worth our labour, and all our pains; but eſpecially if wee conſider this, that though wee are not able to do that that ſhall ſave us, yet God is pleaſed often to convey his ſtrength to thoſe hee doth intend to ſave, through the uſe of thoſe means; rather at that time when they do improve their natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, than at that time when they ſit idle and do nothing, and therefore you muſt bee up and bee doing. Wee read in the Goſpel concerning the young man that I told you came to Chriſt, and inquired what hee ſhould do for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, Chriſt profeſt to him that hee was not <hi>far from the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> hee was not ſo far as others; It is true, if a man abuſes his doing, and reſts in his doing, that ſets him as far from the Kingdome of Heaven, as prophane ones, and <hi>therefore Publicans and Harlots</hi> may enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, as ſoon as <hi>Scribes and Phariſees;</hi> But there may bee many actions done by a common aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods Spirit, that may bring ſome nearer to the Kingdome of Heaven than others; and the denial of ſuch a thing as that is, would bee an extream boldneſs in any;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:168883:154"/> for they are the very words of Chriſt to the young man, That hee was not far from the Kingdome of Heaven; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notwithſtanding your inability, and notwithſtanding the things that wee do are not the things that ſave us, yet wee have ground enough to put on men and women to do.— Now the meaning of this great queſtion is this, What is the way that God ordinarily takes to bring men and women to ſalvation by? or how ſhould I follow God on in his way? that is a certain truth of the Antients, Though God made thee without thee, yet hee will not ſave thee without thee; God works upon us as upon rational creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth concern all the children of men that would have their ſouls ſaved, to obſerve the work of God, and to ſtir up what is in them to joyn with the work of God in the way of ſalvation; and certainly whatever conceits there are to the contrary, they are not onely fooliſh, but extream dangerous, and Satans policy and cunning is exceedingly much ſeen in them.</p>
                     <p>A further thing that I would premiſe before I come to particulars, is this, when I ſpeak of any thing that ſhould bee done, I preſcribe no particular order, knowing that the works of God are various; And ſometimes God ſtirs up a ſoul to do one thing, and ſometimes to do another thing, but take them in what order you will, yet wee muſt name them for memory ſake in ſome order, and God expects them from you, and you are to joyn with God in thoſe works, if you would have your ſouls to bee ſaved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The great Queſtion, of what wee ſhould do to bee ſaved, anſwered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, If you would have your ſouls ſaved, do you joyn with God in what hee hath revealed to you concerning your loſt condition, labouring to underſtand thoſe truths clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that are delivered in the Word concerning the loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſouls by nature, and to work thoſe truths upon your hearts, to bee ſenſible of them: Thoſe whom God
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:168883:154"/> intends to ſave, hee ſhews unto them what this ſalvation is; hee ſhews them from what it is they are to bee ſaved, that ſo they may not run away vvith (the meer word <hi>(Salvation)</hi> and ſaving of ſouls) now God reveals this in his Word, and when hee intends to ſave a ſoul, hee doth by his Spirit ſtir it up to joyn with the Word of God, and work thoſe things upon its ſelf, ſo as to bee made ſenſible of them.</p>
                     <p>As thus, the ſoul being ſolicitous how it ſhould come to bee ſaved, it ſearches the Scripture, and there it findes how wee <hi>are by nature the children of wrath;</hi> there it findes that God had made man <hi>according to his own Image</hi> at firſt, but man hath ſinned againſt God, and broken the covenant upon which his eternal ſtate did depend, and in the ſin of the firſt man all men have ſinned, and are deprived of the glory of God, and now are <hi>conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity,</hi> ſo that there is a moſt dreadful breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the ſoul, and that man by nature is become an enemy to the Infinite God: That now hee hath the ſeeds of all kind of ſin in him, and that all his life, while hee continues in his natural eſtate here, is nothing elſe but a fighting againſt God, a flying in the very face of God: Hee findes that by ſin hee is brought under a moſt dreadful curſe, the curſe of the Law, and that hee is bound over by the bonds of the Law, even to death, to eternal death, as the wages of ſin; theſe things the ſoul findes in Scripture; now if thou wouldeſt bee ſaved, when thou findeſt God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing ſuch things, labour thorowly to convince thy ſoul of the truth of them; and are theſe things ſo indeed? is this my condition? am I thus and thus naturally? Oh what good then will it do to mee to have all the world, and bee in ſuch a condition as this is? Oh my ſoul! when wert thou ſenſible of this condition? doſt thou walk as it becomes one that is ſenſible of ſuch a loſt eſtate as this is? Oh! la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to drink in theſe truths, and to work them upon thy heart, and cry to God to ſet them home upon thy ſpirit, to make thy ſoul thorowly ſenſible of them, as hee uſes to make thoſe whom hee hath a purpoſe to ſave. Here's the firſt thing.</p>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:168883:155"/>
                     <p>And yet one thing about this further, is, That you muſt come to a conviction, not onely of your loſt eſtate, but of your inability to ſave your ſelves, and the inability that there is in all creatures in Heaven and Earth to ſave them; that thy fall from God is ſo dreadful, that all the created power in Heaven and Earth cannot help thee, yea and that thou thy ſelf now art unable to help thy ſelf to ſave thy ſoul; bee convinc'd thorowly of this: This was the way that Chriſt took with the young man, hee tells him of the Law firſt, and then afterwards becauſe hee was conceited that hee had fulfilled the Law, and done it, Chriſt puts him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a duty (that might convince him to the contrary) which was required in the ſpiritual meaning of the Law, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids covetouſneſs, and requires that wee ſhould bee willing to part with all for God, when hee calls for it; <hi>Go and ſell all that thou haſt, and follow mee, and take up thy croſs and follow mee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; I but the young man hee had <hi>great poſſeſſions;</hi> but becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e was no ſwearer, nor ſtealer, nor murderer, nor lyar, hee thought hee had fulfilled the Law, but Chriſt by putting that to him, did as much as if hee ſhould ſay, poor young man, thou art deceived, thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that thou are able to do what God requires in his Law, but didſt thou but underſtand the ſpiritual part of the Law, thou wouldeſt ſee that thou art ſo caſt by it, that all that thou art able to do in thy obedience to the Law, cannot bee ſufficient (through the ſinfulneſs of thy heart and nature) but thou muſt periſh if thou takeſt ſuch a courſe as that is, to think to bee ſaved by the Law; certainly this it is upon which thouſands of ſouls do periſh, they think indeed they are ſinners, but they hope they ſhall do better, and they are able, they think (though not without God, God muſt help them) to do that that the Word of God requires of them, whereby they may come to bee ſaved; now certainly thou knoweſt not thy fallen condition, and how far off thou art from God, and what thy ſinful eſtate is naturally, that haſt ſuch thoughts as theſe.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly, If thou wouldeſt have thy ſoul ſaved, break
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:168883:155"/> off the acts of thy ſin at leaſt; you will ſay, why do we ſpeak to men to break off the acts of their ſin? — why, certainly wee may well ſpeak, for God doth give men power for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts very far; thou canſt not do it of thy ſelf, that is true, but there is a common work of Gods Spirit, that doth inable men and women for outward acts very far: <hi>Let him that ſtole ſteal no more.</hi> A man now at the day of judgement cannot ſay, Lord, I continued in theft, becauſe I was not able to forbear it; though thou canſt not change thy heart indeed, yet forbear the outward act thou canſt: one that is dumb might ſay, if hee could ſpeak, Lord, I was no ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, becauſe I could not ſpeak, otherwiſe thou art ready to ſay, I cannot help it, but God will finde it otherwiſe at the great day: Certainly, if thou wouldeſt but put thy ſelf upon what ſtrength God gives thee, thou mayeſt as well go to a Sermon, as to an Ale-houſe; It is a very falſe reaſoning of people, that becauſe they have not true grace, therefore God inables them to do no outward acts; therefore do what in thee lies to break off the outward acts of thy ſin: Thou that art a company-keeper, a Sabbath-breaker, a ſwearer, an unclean perſon, take heed of continuing in the outward way of ſinning againſt God, reſolve this day againſt thoſe outward acts of thy ſin; do but do thus much, becauſe thou thinkeſt thou canſt do nothing, do but profeſs thus to God in his preſence, when thou art gone, get alone, and ſay, Lord, it is true, I can do nothing-without thee, but here I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf to joyn with whatſoever thou haſt given mee, or ſhalt give mee to abſtain from thoſe acts of ſin, which I have lived in, and this Lord I ingage my ſelf to do, as ever I expect to bee ſaved in the day of Jeſus Chriſt; canſt thou not ſay theſe words? expreſs thy ſelf but thus to God, and certainly theſe things thou mayeſt ſay, and that is ſomewhat; That man and woman that ſhall wilfully go on in thoſe vile groſs acts of ſin that are againſt the very light of nature, and the light of their conſciences, for them to come and ſay, <hi>What ſhall I do to bee ſaved?</hi> and yet ſtill continue in their ſins, it is but a trifling with God, and taking Gods Name in
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:168883:156"/> vain, except it bee with a reſolution to go thus far.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Thou muſt labour to take off thine heart as much as thou canſt from the things of the world, from theſe outward contentments here, from ſeeking after them as thy greateſt good; that that was thy chief deſire heretofore, thou muſt labour to take off thy heart from, and poſſeſs thy ſoul vvith the <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> to conclude thus with thy ſelf, it is not neceſſary that I ſhould be rich, that I ſhould bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, that I ſhould have theſe and theſe outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the world; but it is neceſſary that I ſhould look to the ſalvation of my ſoul; when God hath a purpoſe to ſave, hee doth take the heart off very much from creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; Oh, if peoples hearts were but taken off from the world, to ſeek after ſalvation in a conſtant way, as they are at ſome flaſhes, when they hear ſome truths that come near to their hearts, or when they are upon their ſick-beds, Oh how far might they have been gone in the way of ſalvation! but the thoughts of the world hath taken their hearts, and all other things have vaniſht and come to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If thou wouldeſt have thy ſoul ſaved, thy great care and indeavour muſt bee to acquaint thy ſelf with the knowledge of the Myſteries of the Goſpel of the covenant of grace, of the way that God hath chalkt out for ſalvation; let a man or woman have never ſo good meanings, never ſuch good deſires and affections, live never ſo fairly and civilly in the world, yet if they bee not acquainted with the way that God in the Goſpel, and in the Covenant of Grace hath revealed for the ſalvation of ſouls, they may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for all that, God hath appointed but one way to ſave ſouls, and hee is ſet upon it and determined, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever miſſes that way, muſt periſh, whatſoever good thoughts and deſires they have otherwiſe.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Thou muſt labour to inform thy ſelf of the abſolute neceſſity of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to divine Juſtice, that is revealed in the Goſpel, and that thou muſt come to know, I am a ſinful wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, my ſoul is in a damnable condition; now that that muſt ſave mee muſt ſatisfie Gods infinite Juſtice, I may not bee ſaved meerly by my crying to God for mercy; no, if there were nothing elſe but my crying to God for mercy, yea, put all my good deeds into the ſcale, put what I have done, what I can do, what I can bee inabled to do, all
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:168883:157"/> my prayers, my cries, this will not do. — It is true, there is not enough in mee, but will not Gods mercy eke it out? — No, it is neither what thou doeſt, or canſt do, or canſt be inabled to do, and put Gods mercy meerly without any more, that doth it, but it is a ſatisfaction to juſtice, a price paid for the ſoul; no ſoul is ever ſaved, but it is ſaved in the way of a price, that is paid for it; and this thou muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſoul with, which thouſands of people are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of; yet they hope to bee ſaved, but how? they will pray to God that they may bee ſaved, and that God would have mercy upon them; and is here all? certainly this is not the way of the Goſpel; but the way of the Goſpel it is that that reveals unto the ſoul the price that is paid for a ſoul, even the blood of Chriſt: That in Chriſt the great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of the ſecond Covenant, there is a perfect ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Gods Infinite Juſtice; this indeed is a great part of the Myſtery of the Goſpel; this is the ſaving truth of the Goſpel, and thou muſt acquaint thy ſoul with this truth if thou bee ſaved. — And when thou heareſt of this truth, perhaps thou canſt not underſtand it for the preſent, Oh then thou hadſt need go to God in ſecret, and bee crying to him that hee would reveal this truth unto thee. — But you will ſay, it is not our crying; — It is true, it is not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our crying, but there is ſomething of God further: But God hath made many gracious promiſes of anſwering our cries, and now that ſo hee may make good his promiſes, hee will further reveal this Myſtery of the Goſpel to thee, that there is a neceſſity of ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice for thy ſin that hath brought thy ſoul into a loſt condition.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, And further, A neceſſity of a perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; wee will not ſpeak of any thing controverſal about it, which way it comes to bee applied; but this all will grant, that there is a perfect Righteouſneſs that wee have need of; the way of ſalvation is a perfect Righteouſneſs, thou muſt have a ſurety that muſt have a perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for thee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And then the way of ſalvation is this, it reveals
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:168883:157"/> an abſolute neceſſity of the Application of the ſatisfaction and Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; the Application of that, that it muſt bee made thine ſome way, that thou muſt have thy part and ſhare in it, by thy union unto Chriſt; and by being made one myſtically with him through Faith, ſo that the ſoul is not meerly ſaved through mercy: Nor thus, that Chriſt hee hath come and done ſuch and ſuch things, and therefore ſaith God the Father, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt I will ſave thee, for hee hath ſatisfied mee by what hee hath done: No, but there is ſomewhat more; I confeſs it is true, in the concluſion wee are ſaved for the ſake of Chriſt, but it is by our union with Chriſt, wee are united to Chriſt, and made one with him, and ſo what Chriſt hath done for our ſalvation, is tendred up to the Father as ours, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that now, if thou ſhouldeſt know thy miſerable eſtate by nature, and thereupon inquire after ſalvation, and cry to God that hee would bee merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto thee; that is not enough, but the Goſpel reveals further. Suppoſe thou comeſt to know more than thou canſt underſtand by the light of nature, but yet the Goſpel doth reveal to thee, that not onely thou muſt bee ſaved by Chriſt, but thou muſt bee united to Chriſt by Faith; there muſt bee a ſpiritual marriage between the Son of God, and thy ſoul; thou muſt have Chriſt to bee a head, and thou a member; hee thy husband, and thou his Spouſe; thou muſt inquire after this union, and that is the way of beleeving, and the ſubſtance of the Apoſtles words to the Jaylor, when hee cryed, what hee ſhould do to bee ſaved, why ſaith hee, <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt bee ſaved:</hi> It muſt bee through Jeſus Chriſt, the great Mediatour of the ſecond Covenant, by thy beleeving in him, and being made one with him that thou muſt come to bee ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, And then the Goſpel it reveals further as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, a neceſſity of Regeneration, of being <hi>born again,</hi> of having the Image of God renewed in the ſoul, by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, of being a new Creature, the want of which, if the ſoul ſhould now depart, it muſt
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:168883:158"/> certainly periſh under, but now if it come to bee ſaved, it muſt have this revealed to it; for in the Goſpel there is held forth the great work of God in begetting that ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new to himſelf, that hee doth intend to ſave, in putting a new life into it, in ſending the Spirt of Jeſus Chriſt into it, whereby it lives, and acts, and works, being now carried on, not by its own ſpirit, but by the Spirit of the Son of God; this is neceſſary to ſalvation, to do acts of Regeneration: ſo Chriſt tells <hi>Nicodomus,</hi> hee muſt bee <hi>born again,</hi> and this onely the Goſpel reveals; and thus our ſouls ſhould labour to acquaint themſelves with the great things of the Goſpel; and as the wiſe man ſaith concerning inſtruction, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Take faſt hold of inſtruction, let her not go, keep her, for ſhee is thy life.</hi> So I ſay of theſe inſtructions that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel, keep them, for they are your lives; do not think that God, though hee is infinitely merciful, yet that hee will ſave ſouls any other way, for God hath ſet this way, and it is an infinite mercy that wee are to admire at, and adore, and praiſe his Name for, that there may bee ſalvation any way; and if there may be ſalvation any way, oh you poor wretched children of men! know, that you ſhould be reſtleſs, till you come to underſtand further that one way; Oh that wee could make it to bee the great buſineſs of our lives, to ſearch into the Goſpel, and finde out theſe things, for it is through this that we come to have eternal life.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A fifth rule for the ſalvation of your ſouls, (If God hath put it into your hearts to ſeek to have them ſaved) you muſt walk with fear and trembling before the Lord all the daies of your lives; the fear of God muſt bee mighty and ſtrong upon your ſpirits, if you would bee ſaved, and you muſt labour to keep the fear of the great God upon your ſpirits; that place is famous for this, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> As if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay, you had need walk with fear before the Lord, for the truth is, hee hath you at ſuch infinite advantage, as you are not able to ſtir
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:168883:158"/> one foot to do any thing for the deliverance of your ſouls from eternal wrath, without the work of God upon you; you had need take heed what you do, that you do not provoke this infinite God that hath you under his feet, that you are able to do nothing towards your ſalvation if hee withdraw himſelf from you.</p>
                     <p>I appeal to you, ſuppoſe you did ſo depend upon any one man in the world, that your life lay at his mercy, and if hee ſhould but ſpeak a word you were a dead man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, would you not when you come into his preſence come with fear, leſt you ſhould diſpleaſe him? would you ſay, what do I care for him? let him bee pleaſed or not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, what is that to mee? you would not dare to do it: Now, ſhall wee have leſs fear, becauſe hee with whom wee have to do is the Lord? if wee had dependence upon any man in the world, as wee have upon God, wee would fear him: Now I ſay, ſhall God have the leſs fear, becauſe hee is a God? hee ſhould have the more fear; <hi>Fear him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that when hee hath killed the body, can likewiſe kill the ſoul; Yea I ſay unto you, fear him;</hi> Chriſt puts an <hi>I ſay</hi> upon that; and truly, that ſoul begins to bee in a way of ſalvation, that begins to have the fear of the great God to fall upon him. Moſt people in the world they walk boldly, and preſumptuouſly in the preſence of God, as if God had nothing to do with them, and as if they had nothing to do with God. Alas! theſe go on in the waies of death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: but that ſoul that God hath a purpoſe to ſave, hee begins to reveal his glory to it, and to ſhine upon it, as hee did upon <hi>Saul,</hi> when hee did ſhine from Heaven in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, and ſtopt him in his way when hee was riding poſt unto Hell and deſtruction; hee cries to him, <hi>I am hee that thou haſt ſinned againſt, I am hee that thou perſecuteſt,</hi> then <hi>Saul</hi> falls down trembling, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, What wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t thou have mee to do?</hi> as if <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould ſay, Lord, I did not know thee, but I ſee thee now to bee a great and a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, I ſee that I am in thy hands to ſave or deſtroy, as thou pleaſeſt; and therefore <hi>Saul</hi> comes with a trembling
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:168883:159"/> heart, and cries to God, <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have mee to do?</hi> I, hee was in a good way of ſalvation; and ſo when a vile ſinner that hath gone on without the fear of God upon him, ſhall now come in trembling, beholding the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Infinite God, that eternal firſt-beeing that it hath to deal withall, and now ſhall have his fear ſtrike into it, this ſoul is in a good way of ſalvation, it is ſtopt in the way of deſtruction, and it is in a good way of ſalvation; and that is very obſervable further in the Text, <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that works in you.</hi> That is a place that many people groſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, they think they need do nothing; but mark how bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do theſe people croſs the Spirit of God in the Text, for the Spirit of God makes this Argument, do you work out your ſalvation, becauſe God works, and ſay they, It muſt bee God that works, and therefore I will do nothing; Oh! if you ſhould wilfully go on in waies of provocation to God, and upon your ſick-bed, and death-bed, cry, Oh Lord! that now thou wouldeſt bee pleaſed to work upon my ſoul, as thou uſeſt to work upon thoſe that thou intendeſt to ſave; If God ſhould make this anſwer, Thou a bold wretch, that haſt provok'd the eyes of my glory all thy daies, and doſt thou now cry to mee to do it? If any of you do think that there will ever bee a time when you will ſtand in need of Gods mercy to ſave your ſouls, you had need walk with fear and trembling before this God; Now I put this to the ſoul of every one here, doſt thou not think, O thou ſinful ſoul, that there will bee a time that thou ſhalt ſtand in need of the mercy of God? and what courſe doſt thou take now before-hand? is that courſe that thou takeſt before-hand a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al provocation of God? is that a good preparation to that time? if there were a man that you lived neer, though for the preſent you care not for him, but ſlighted him, yet if you knew that there would bee a time that you muſt ſtand in need of that man, ſo as if hee ſhould forſake you, you would bee a loſt man, would you dare to provoke that man? wee all know what need wee ſhall have of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:168883:159"/> of God, and therefore wee had need walk with fear and trembling before him.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Further, If thou wouldeſt have thy ſoul ſaved, attend upon thoſe means that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>od hath appointed to ſave ſouls, wait at wiſdomes poſts. Now this one direction being clearly ſhewn out of Scripture, will be enough to confute all that talk againſt doing: If God hath appointed means to ſave, then ſurely hee hath appointed that wee muſt attend upon thoſe means. Now in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. The preaching of the Goſpel there is called, <hi>The power of God to ſalvation.</hi> Now if you would bee ſaved, you muſt bring your ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that which is the power of God to ſalvation. Becauſe the Lord in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel doth uſe to put forth his Almighty Power for the ſaving of ſouls, therefore it is that the Goſpel is called the power of God to ſalvation; you cannot be ſaved without the Almighty Power of God, and where is that put forth but in the preaching of the Goſpel? <hi>To whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> That is, the Arm of God in the preaching of the Goſpel; ſo you know what the Apoſtle ſaith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You will ſay, can wee do any thing towards our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? yes, you may hear, it is the duty of us as creatures to come and hear the Word; and Faith comes by hearing: ſo then Faith comes by ſomewhat that wee do, but not ſo that God hath tied himſelf to give Faith to every one that hears, I would not bee underſtood ſo: But thus, God hath appointed, that hearing ſhould bee a means for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith; It is true, it is the bleſſing of God in hearing, but hearing is the way that God hath ſet; God indeed can convey Faith from Heaven to any ſoul immediately; I but where there is the preaching of the Goſpel, there do I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that theſe creatures that do intend that I ſhould work Faith in them, ſhould come and attend upon the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel: Chriſt could have opened the blind mans eyes, without ſpitting upon the clay, and anointing his face, but hee would have that done, and that muſt bee the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:168883:160"/> means by which hee will open his eyes: So if God will have hearing the Word of the Goſpel to bee the means by which hee will work Faith in the ſoul, take heed how this bee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.18. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to preach, to what end? <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Faith that is in mee.</hi> Saith the Lord Chriſt to <hi>Paul,</hi> I will ſend thee to open the eyes of men, and to turn them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins; and this is the great ordinance that I intend for this end, and that I will accompany to thoſe that I purpoſe to ſave at any time. Therefore when you come to hear the Word, you ſhould come to it as the great Ordinance that God hath appointed to ſave ſouls by. Is there any ſoul that begins in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to bee awakened, and to think with it ſelf, Oh Lord, <hi>What ſhall I do to bee ſaved?</hi> I tell thee, that every time thou comeſt to hear the Word preached, thou ſhouldeſt come to it with ſuch thoughts as theſe; Now am I going to that great Ordinance that the Lord hath appointed to convey his power thorow, to the ſalvation of thoſe ſouls that are appointed to eternal life; I am going to the <hi>Pool of Betheſda,</hi> and there will I wait until the Lord ſhall bee pleaſed for to ſend his <hi>Angel</hi> to ſtir in my heart, and I have begun to feel ſome power of Chriſt already, which doth incourage mee to hope for further power; There is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſoul hath met with Jeſus Chriſt, and hee hath brought it from the power of Satan, to his own Kingdome of light, and why may not my ſoul meet with the ſame power of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? however, I am reſolved, that as long as I live, I will wait upon God in the way that hee hath appointed; Oh the Word it hath a great deal of efficacy for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſouls, therefore if thou wouldeſt have thy ſoul ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, attend upon it for that end. I ſhall apply one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which may bee for the preparation to what remains.— You are about inquiring how you ſhould bee ſaved, and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:168883:160"/> wee are about anſwering, Oh take heed that you bee not found in this, like unto thoſe wretched Jews (which God forbid that there ſhould bee any one in this place found like unto) that would fain have the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> be inquiring what the mind of God was concerning them, and they profeſt, that whatſoever the Lord ſhould reveal by him, that they would do, but when it came, loe they fling off all, and it was to no purpoſe; the Scripture is in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.5. Then they ſaid to <hi>Jeremiah, The Lord bee a true and a faithful witneſs between us, if wee do not even according to all things, for the which the Lord thy God ſhall ſend thee to us.</hi> Wee deſire thee to go and know the mind of God, and tell it us, and here wee profeſs and call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that wee will do what lies in us to perform all that the Lord thy God ſhall require; This was a very fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and I hope there are ſome ſouls, if not generally all of you, have ſuch a kinde of diſpoſition. Oh let his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſearch his Word, and finde out what ſhould be done, and whatſoever hee ſhall ſpeak according to his Word, that will wee do, and God forbid it ſhould bee otherwiſe; it were juſt with God that our ſouls ſhould periſh, if wee ſhould do otherwiſe; but there is a mighty deal of deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the hearts of men; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> went, and did as they deſired him, but mark, <hi>chap.</hi> 44. 16. and you ſhall ſee what a different diſpoſition there was in them, to what there ſeemed to bee before; firſt you ſhall finde in <hi>chap.</hi> 43. they begin to wrangle at what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpake to them, all the proud men began to wrangle at what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpake, mark, it is all the proud men, they are proud ſpirits that do contend with Gods Word, but mark, firſt they wrangle, <hi>chap.</hi> 43.2. and then they grow reſolute and ſtubborn, <hi>chap.</hi> 44.16. As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; why, what, are theſe the men that called God to witneſs, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſhould declare in the Name of God, they would do it? and yet now, firſt they wrangle at what he ſaith, and then they reſolve, that as for what hee hath ſpoken to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:168883:161"/> them in the Name of the Lord, they will not hear it: Now God forbid that ever there ſhould bee found among any of you ſuch wrangling ſpirits with the Word of God; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God will juſtifie the words of his ſervants that they ſpeak in his Name one day, and will make them good upon you, and they may lye heavy upon the ſoul that ſhall neglect them; but then where there is firſt wrangling at the Word of God, there uſually grows an impudent, proud, ſtubborn, caſting off the Word of God; <hi>As for the word that thou haſt ſpoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, wee will not hearken unto thee.</hi> Why ſhould not wee do what wee have a mind to? why ſhould not wee take our liberty on the Lords day, as vvee vvere vvont, and follovv our buſineſs as vvee vvere vvont? let them ſay vvhat they vvill, vvee vvill do as vvee vvere vvont to do, and vvee vvill keep our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as vvee vvere vvont to do; let them ſpeak vvhile their heart akes; this vvas the very guize of this people that made ſuch a profeſſion before the Lord, but oh the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that it ſhould bee ſo vvith any of you.</p>
                     <p>But Seventhly, If thou vvouldeſt have thy ſoul ſaved, thou muſt take heed of reſting upon falſe hopes of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, you muſt raſe down even to the very ground all your falſe hopes of ſalvation; there is nothing in the vvorld hinders the ſalvation of ſouls more than falſe hopes; vvhen men dare build their eternal ſalvation upon every ſleight and vain hope that they hold, <hi>The hope of the Hypocrite,</hi> the Scriptuie ſaith, <hi>is like the Spiders-webb,</hi> ſpun out of thine ovvn conceits, but every little touch is enough to ſtrike it dovvn again: Oh the poor things that people thus venture their ſouls upon! I ſhevved you in the opening of vvhat did cauſe the loſs of ſouls, that one thing vvas by venturing, and their vain hopes vvas one; novv theſe muſt bee ras'd dovvn; you vvill ſay, vvhat are thoſe vain hopes that muſt firſt bee ras'd dovvn? and vvhat do you mean by raſing of them dovvn?</p>
                     <p>That I may ſpeak plainly in this thing, that concerns the pooreſt and meaneſt, that is of the meaneſt capacity in the

                     <p>Firſt, Such hopes as are not Scripture-hopes, if they bee not Scripture hopes, they muſt bee raſed down; <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that wee through patience and comfort of the Scripture might have hope.</hi> Wee have hope through patience and comfort of the Scripture; how doth the hopes of thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved ariſe? — Why, they riſe thus, either by reading, or hearing ſomething out of the Word of God, and God darting ſome light, ſome truths into their ſouls through his Word, they come to receive it, and there it lies working in them, till at length their ſouls reliſh it, and they taſte the ſweetneſs of the Word, and come to have comfort in it, and ſo through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, their hope comes to bee raiſed; the Scripture in raiſing hopes, firſt it works patience, it uſually beats down the ſoul firſt, and ſpeaks hard things to it, and the ſoul that God over-powers to himſelf, it is willing to lye under the power of the Scripture, and bee patient, notwithſtanding the Scripture doth reveal ſuch hard things, and puts it upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch hard duties, the heart, I ſay, yeelds to it, and at length the ſoul comes to finde ſweetneſs out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo hopes comes to bee raiſed, that is, the ſoul ſees ſome eternal truth out of the Word of God, the truth of God himſelf that is eternal, a divine truth that it dares ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture its eternal eſtate upon, and upon this it doth raiſe its hope; it is able to give an account from ſome place of the Scripture, upon what grounds it doth hope. — I hope that God will ſhew mercy to mee, and ſave my ſoul in the day of Chriſt; will ſome ſay, I but what ground have you for your hopes? Now, if your hopes bee right, then there is ſomewhat in this Book of God to bee ſhewed as the ground of this; and indeed you can have but little comfort of your

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:168883:162"/> the more his heart is wrought upon by the Scripture, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grows to bee liker and liker to the Scripture, to come nearer and nearer to what is required in the Scripture; but now when a gracious heart doth reſt upon Scripture, it findes that daily it doth grow nearer and nearer to the Scripture, and that works daily more and more upon it; and indeed this is the way to grow in ſanctification, and to make our hearts like to the Scriptures. Fall upon ſeveral places, and let your ſouls reſt upon them for eternity, and ſo you will finde your hearts to grow more and more like to thoſe Scriptures, and the power of thoſe Scriptures will appear more and more in your hearts and converſations. This is the way of the Saints that have hopes to bee ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Again, thoſe hopes that are to be raſed, are hopes that are not wrought in the ſoul by the power of the Holy Ghoſt: in the forenamed Chapter, <hi>The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in beleeving, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> That hope that is right for ſalvation, is ſuch a hope as is wrought through the power of the Holy Ghoſt: Now then, that hope that is in men and women, which is born with them, and hath lived with them all their daies, that ſprings from the root of nature, for ſo that that is born with us, and grows up with us all the daies of our lives, I ſay, it ſprings from a root of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo the hopes of moſt people, they are no other but ſuch as ſprings from a root of nature; come from one to another, and ask them, do you think to bee ſaved? I, I hope ſo; how long have you hoped ſo? ever ſince I can remember, I thank God; I, I thought ſo; it is a hope that ſprings out of the root of nature, and therefore you have had it alwaies, whereas the true hope of the godly for ſalvation, it is a hope wrought in their hearts by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>And I appeal to you now, what Almighty power of the Holy Ghoſt have you felt in your hearts to raiſe up thoſe hopes that you have in you? — For certainly the grace
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:168883:163"/> of hope hath a difficulty in it, as well as any grace whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; now all people almoſt finde an eaſineſs in that; but here the Scripture makes it to bee the glory of the Holy Ghoſt, to raiſe hopes in any creature; therefore thoſe hopes that ariſe from a root of nature, that are not wrought by an Almighty power of the Holy Ghoſt in the heart, muſt bee raſed down. — Do but put your ſouls to this queſtion, I have hopes to bee ſaved, but Lord, how are they wrought? what power of the Holy Ghoſt hath been in my heart to raiſe theſe hopes? Suppoſe there were no Holy Ghoſt (as they ſaid in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that they had not ſo much as heard <hi>whether there were any Holy Ghoſt or no</hi>) yet might not I have ſuch a hope as I have in Gods mercy? Oh the hope that will bring to ſalvation is ſuch a hope as is raiſed by the power of the Holy Ghoſt. — Now if our hopes bee raiſed by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, then they will have much of the Holy Ghoſt in them, and ſutable to your hopes, ſo doth the Holy Ghoſt come into your hearts, and dwell in your hearts, and if it comes in and dwells in your hearts, then it doth inlighten your hearts, it doth act and guide you, you are lead by the Holy Ghoſt in your way; Now, can you ſay, that in the courſe of your lives, it is the Holy Ghoſt that guides you, that you are carried on by the Holy Ghoſt, and not by your own ſpirits; It is true, the beſt of all may bee acted by their own ſpirits, in ſome time of temptation, but for the courſe of their lives they are acted and guided by the Holy Ghoſt, their lives are ſuch, as thoſe that live by them may ſay, here is one that is acted and guided by the Holy Ghoſt; Now, can you ſay ſo? certainly if you have true hopes for ſalvation, it is raiſed by the Holy Ghoſt, and if it bee raiſed by the Holy Ghoſt, it doth act your lives in the waies of holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Thoſe hopes muſt bee raſed down that are not lively hopes, and purging hopes, I will put them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. — That are not lively, that you have in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed bee the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:168883:163"/> lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> Here is a great deal in this Scripture; Firſt, that the hopes of the Saints are lively hopes, that is, a hope as is mightily working in them, it will not ſuffer their hearts to lye dead in any way of wickedneſs; Indeed, it may bee with the hearts of the Saints, as it is with a fountain of living water, that may have ſome dirt caſt into it, but it being a living ſpring, it works out that dirt; ſo the children of God that have ſome lively hopes, may have ſome dirt caſt in by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; ſome ſin, I, but if their hopes bee lively, it will work it all out. — And mark, <hi>you are begotten,</hi> therefore you ſee that the hopes of life and ſalvation it is that that is not bred with us (as I ſpake before) but it is that that follows from our new birth. — And this is by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead. The power and the virtue of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead being in the ſoul, and putting a new life into the ſoul, begets it to this lively hope.</p>
                     <p>And then it is a purging hope, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>And every man that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf even as hee is pure.</hi> Mark, you think, what need men bee ſo pure and ſtrict? are there none of you that ever have ſcorn'd at purity, and preciſeneſs, and holineſs? if you have, conſider of this text upon which your ſouls lies; every man that hath this hope, that is, to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, and bee made like unto him, hee doth here in this world purifie himſelf, as Jeſus Chriſt is pure, that is, hee doth make Jeſus Chriſt to bee his pattern in all that hee doth, and aims at no leſs purity, than the very purity of the Son of God; hee doth aim at it, hee makes it his work, though hee cannot come fully to it, and that very hope that is in him doth work him to this; Now what hopes you have had that are not ſuch, muſt bee raſed down to the ground, if ever you would bee ſaved at laſt.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, You ſhould bee willing to ſeek to God, and that earneſtly, that hee would never let you bee at quiet in any falſe hope, be earneſt with God in prayer: O Lord, I ſee that the matter of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is a matter of infinite conſequence; if I ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, if I ſhould miſcarry in it, it had been better for mee never to have been born; O Lord! therefore help mee in this thing above all, that I may never reſt my ſalvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any falſe hopes, that ſo I may not at the laſt bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of my laſt hopes; bee earneſt thus with God, and bee willing to know the worſt of your ſelves; Lord, if
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:168883:164"/> thou ſeeſt the work bee not yet done let mee know it, let mee know it now, before it is too late; It is better to know that yet the work is to begin, while you have time to work, than to know it after when the time is gone: And then, bee willing to examine your hopes, to lay them to the rule of the Scripture, and that very narrowly: And if you finde your hopes cannot ſtand with the Word, then reſolve thus with your ſelves, the work is yet to bee done, the very laying of the foundation of that great work, of the ſaving of my ſoul, it is to begin: — I but you will ſay, God forbid this, wee have not lived all this while, to begin to lay the work for the ſaving of our ſouls now, that were an ill thing indeed: — O I would to God it were not ſo! but this very thought that ſome have, that they are not now to begin the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aying of the foundation in ſaving their ſouls, is that that doth deſtroy them, whereas, though a man or woman have lived many years, yea though they have been Profeſſours of Religion, yet if upon examination they can finde that the ſaving work of God is not wrought in their hearts, and upon that can conclude, Lord it is to begin, for ought I know, I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the work again, and better it is to begin twice, than bee damned once, therefore whatſoever becomes of mee, I will begin again; this were a good ſign: Suppoſe you ſhould begin again, and it may bee you thought too ill of your ſelves, for it may bee there was ſome truth in your hopes, or hearts, that you could not ſee, yet there is no great danger in this, that that was good will hold, though you do not ſee it; it is the ſafeſt way for men and women there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bee willing to begin often, yea and ſometimes it is the beſt and the readieſt courſe for people that have loſt their evidences for ſalvation, and they can ſee no clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences out of Gods Word to ſettle their hearts upon, for the great matter of their ſalvation; I ſay, it is the readieſt way for them to do as if they were to begin again, rather than to ſpend time in looking out their old evidences; as a man perhaps that hath loſt his evidences may have them renewed with leſs charge and coſt than hee can ſeek them out, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:168883:165"/> ſo ſometimes it is with the ſoul when it hath loſt its eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for ſalvation, it may get new in leſs time, and with leſs charge, than to ſeek out the old. It may bee thou lookeſt to ſee whether thou haſt not been an Hypocrite all this while, or formal: Suppoſe upon examination thou canſt not finde any thing to ſatisfie thy ſoul, but that it hath been ſo, yet now, what hinders but that thou mayeſt this inſtant throw thy ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt? I but I am afraid that when I have come to Chriſt, I have not come rightly. — I but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou mayeſt come to Chriſt in that time that thou mayeſt know whether thou haſt come rightly, yea or nay: — But now the beſt way for thoſe that are mightily troubled and ſolicitous about evidences whether their eſtate bee right or no, I ſay, let thoſe, rather than ſpend too much time in diſcouraging of their own hearts, begin the work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; let ſuch a one preſent Jeſus Chriſt now as a Saviour for loſt man, whoſe grace is infinitely full, and infinitely free; and there is nothing hinders thee but that thou mayeſt at this very inſtant caſt thy ſelf upon him to bee thy Saviour, both to ſave thee from ſin, and from condemnation.</p>
                     <p>I but you will ſay, I may preſume, and who hath right to do any ſuch thing?</p>
                     <p>To that I anſwer, that there is nothing can give thee right to Chriſt, but by caſting thy ſoul upon him, by beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, that right that wee have to Chriſt, it is by beleeving: It is not by any work before beleeving that gives thee right to Jeſus Chriſt: So that by this you ſee what I mean by raſing down the old foundation.</p>
                     <p>The next is, by laying the new foundation of this great work of thy ſalvation, and bee ſure thou lay that ſure.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay, lay it ſure, what is it?</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is the foundation, <hi>No other foundation can bee laid but Chriſt himſelf;</hi> lay it there: — And then that that is next to Chriſt the foundation, it is the true work of Faith, and the true work of Repentance; the true work of Faith that is next, that is the foundation of what is wrought in our hearts; Chriſt is the foundation firſt, but of any work

                     <p>Firſt, For the Word; The ſoul that God intends to ſave, hee doth reveal unto it a dreadful authority that there is in this Book of God; this is that word, ſaith God to the ſoul, wherein I have revealed my mind to the children of men: Thoſe counſels of my will that concern the eternal good of the children of men are in this book, and all your ſouls are to be caſt by this book, by this word, for eternity: Now this being revealed to the ſoul, the ſoul ſtands in awe of this word, and trembles at this word, fears the authority of it, looks upon every threatning in the Word, every command in the Word, every promiſe in the Word, as having a divine authority ſtampt upon it, ſees the broad Seal of Heaven ſtampt upon every thing in this Book, and dares not wilfully tranſgreſs againſt any thing in the Word, and ſo continues in keeping its ſelf under the dreadful authority of the Word; and that ſoul is in a good forwardneſs to bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that is kept under the dreadful authority of Gods Word, in the conſtant courſe of it: Now I appeal to you, you would fain have your ſouls ſaved, but can you ſay thus?

Now if thy caſe bee thus, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall plead againſt thee, and ſay, Oh Father, Father, avenge thy ſelf upon this wretch, that hath not onely ſinned againſt thy work of Creation, but againſt the work of Redemption, that I went into the world to work; Father, let this ſoul periſh eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hath rejected mee, and received every baſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luſt before mee; now, ſhall that ſoul bee ſaved that ſhall have the blood of the Covenant cry againſt it, and mercy it ſelf cry to the Lord againſt it, Lord, avenge my cauſe, for I have been moſt abominably and curſedly abuſed by this wretch? when not onely the Law of Gods Juſtice,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:168883:169"/> and Satan accuſes thee, but Chriſt, and his blood, and the Goſpel it ſelf, how ſhall ſuch a ſoul bee ſaved? now then, if you would have your ſouls ſaved, take heed of ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the Goſpel, and againſt the blood of God, and againſt the mercy of God.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, If thou wouldeſt have thy ſoul ſaved, take heed of ſinning againſt the Spirit of Grace, the good Spirit of God, that muſt draw thee to Chriſt, and guide thee in the way of ſalvation, if ever thou beeſt ſaved.</p>
                     <p>Now, take heed of ſleighting the motions of Gods Spirit, oh do not ſleight any motion of the Spirit of God; how doſt thou know, but when there comes in any motion of Gods Spirit, it comes in to ſave thee at this time? thou canſt not tell but that at any time when Gods Spirit doth aſſiſt his Word, thy ſoul may depend upon that time, ſo as God may ſay, had this ſoul followed on the work at this time, it might have been ſaved; but upon its not following it on, it ſhall not bee ſaved; doth Gods Spirit begin to move thy ſoul, when thou art hearing the Word? Oh do not go into wicked company, and ſo loſe all again, but get alone in thy cloſet, and fall down even upon thy face, and cry to God, that hee would follow on the work of his Spirit, that hee hath begun in thee: Oh Lord, I lived a long time in a dead-hearted condition, never minding the good of my ſoul, but thou haſt begun to ſtir mee, and Lord, I hope it is the beginning of thy ſaving work upon my ſoul; Oh that thou wouldeſt go on with it. How many upon their ſick-beds and death-beds, would give a thouſand worlds (if they had them) that they could have ſuch ſtirrings of the Spirit of God, as ſometimes they have felt? Oh now when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtirs, and temptation ſtirs, take heed of liſtening to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and rejecting the motions of Gods Spirit, but think of that that wee read on of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were going to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were very near <hi>Canaan,</hi> and when they were upon the borders of it, they refuſed to go into the Land, when God would have them, and upon that <hi>The Lord did ſwear in his wrath,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal 95.10.</note> 
                        <hi>that they ſhould never enter
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:168883:169"/> into his reſt:</hi> So when the Spirit of God begins to bring thee near to ſalvation, that it may bee ſaid of thee, as Chriſt to the young man, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> O take heed of hearkening to temptation, leſt the Lord ſwear that thou ſhalt never enter into Heaven. The Spirit of God, which is like unto the Dove in the Ark, perhaps it comes into thy heart once, and it comes in again, and thou ſendeſt it out again, but take heed of ſending it out the third time, leſt it ſhould never come in to thee again;<note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> but that the Lord ſhould ſay, Spirit, never <hi>ſtrive more</hi> with ſuch a ſoul: Oh when God begins to ſtir, it doth concern you, to ſay with <hi>Samuel, Lord, ſpeak, for thy ſervant hears.</hi> You that have been forward heretofore, and have loſt the work of Gods Spirit, you had need look about you, for it is a dangerous thing to draw back; <hi>My ſoul,</hi> ſaith God,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.38.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall have no pleaſure in thoſe that ſhall draw back.</hi> And if the ſoul of God will have no pleaſure in thee, how ſhall thy ſoul bee ſaved?</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, Whoſoever would have their ſouls ſaved, let them take this courſe, account the preciouſneſs of the time of your lives to conſiſt in this, that it is a day of ſalvation; account it therefore a mercy of God that your lives are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upon this reaſon, not becauſe you may get great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and live and have your pleaſures and delights, but becauſe God hath appointed the time of mans life here in this world, to bee the time to provide for his eternity; few men and women in the world know how to judge aright of the preciouſneſs of their time, the time of their lives; and that man or woman that comes to know aright how to judge of the preciouſneſs of this time of life, and of what doth depend upon it, ſuch a one is in a good forwardneſs to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Thirteenthly, The laſt thing that I ſhall Name is this, bee ſure to go with thoſe that go in the ſafeſt way, and the ſtraighteſt way; many of you, you queſtion about many things that others do, whether they need do ſo or no; why can none bee ſaved but thoſe that do ſo? but I appeal to your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, do not you think the ſtricteſt way of godlineſs is the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:168883:170"/> ſafeſt way for ſalvation? now, if it bee the ſafeſt, if you did but underſtand the infinite conſequence of the ſalvation of your ſouls, there need bee no other Argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to any ſtrict way of godlineſs, but this; whatever it bee, whether abſolutely neceſſary, or no, I am ſure it is the ſafeſt way; and I am ſure there was never yet any upon his ſick-bed that did repent him that hee was too ſtrict and too preciſe, but I have known many that have repented them of being too looſe, and too careleſs: Now in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is of great conſequence, you will bee ſure to take the ſafeſt way: If there bee any people in the world that walk ſo as your conſciences tell you they are in a more ſtrict way than others, more holy, more cloſe to God, more ſelf-denying, more faithful, it doth concern you to inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe, and to walk after thoſe, and joyn with them; ſurely thoſe that go on in the ſafeſt way for the ſalvation of their ſouls, thoſe I will make a pattern to mee; I will not look what the common courſe of the world, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the world doth; The Scripture tells us that <hi>There are but few that ſhall bee ſaved;</hi> And therefore the fewneſs of men ſhall never diſcourage mee; bee they never ſo few, bee they never ſo mean, If I am perſwaded in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience it is the ſafeſt way, that is the way that I will walk in, and ſurely it is the way for the ſoul to have comfort at the great day, when it ſhall appear before the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. I beſeech you conſider of this, if you were all now to appear before Jeſus Chriſt, to have your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal eſtates determined of, in what mens conditions would you wiſh your ſelves to be in? if it might bee at your liberty, and Chriſt ſhould ſay, now I am to paſs the ſentence of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity upon you for your ſalvation or damnation; now what kind of mens eſtates would you wiſh your ſelves to be in? who would you rather be like unto? who would you venture moſt upon, to be dealt withall according as your conſciences do think they are moſt like to bee dealt with? I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if this were the caſe, moſt looſe, and prophane, and ungodly men, would run and cling unto thoſe that now
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:168883:170"/> they ſcorn and contemn; unto thoſe that walk with the moſt ſtrictneſs and holineſs in their converſations: Certainly if you would do ſo <hi>Then,</hi> it is your wiſdome to do ſo <hi>Now;</hi> that which will bee true then, certainly is true now; and therefore that is a good way for the helping to ſave your ſouls, to joyn with thoſe that walk in the ſtricteſt and the holieſt way, to do that now, that if you were to die, you would wiſh you had done; and to bee with them now, that if you were to have the ſentence of eternity paſt upon you, you would wiſh you had been withall. But this ſhall ſuffice for what is to bee ſaid concerning that great Queſtion, about the preventing the loſs of our ſouls, and what wee ſhould do to bee ſaved: — Now for the concluſion; you have heard divers things already, about the way, and direction for the ſaving of ſouls; I ſuppoſe when firſt the Queſtion was raiſed, every one of you would bee greedy to hear an anſwer; There was never a one in this place but would fain have his ſoul ſaved eternally; what do you mean to do now? what are your thoughts? there hath been a queſtion, and I have indeavoured in the Name of God to anſwer it; Now this is that that I deſire of you even before you ſleep, get into the preſence of God alone, and give in your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to God, what you mean to do, are you reſolved upon it? will you ingage your ſouls now to God (this evening) that that little time that hee will let you live in this world, that your indeavours ſhall bee according to thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that have been opened unto you? Oh bleſſed bee God if this bee but in any one ſoul! but can any one think that among ſuch a multitude as this is, but that the Lord would bee pleaſed to dart ſome thing or other into one or more. Let mee conclude at this time, as the ſervant of <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaid to him, when the Prophet gave him direction what hee ſhould do to bee cleanſed, hee began to bee angry, and was loath to do what the Prophet bid him; why (ſaith his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to him) My Father, <hi>If the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldeſt thou not have done it? how much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then when hee ſaith to thee, waſh and bee clean?</hi> So I ſay
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:168883:171"/> to you; conſidering what the worth of your ſouls is, and the danger there is of your eternal miſcarrying, how if God ſhould have ſaid this, That ſo your ſouls may bee ſaved, I require of every one of you that you ſhould for forty, fifty years lie as a head-block at the fire burning; I, and if God ſhould have ſaid thus unto us from Heaven, wee had all cauſe to have fallen upon our faces, and have bleſſed God for his mercy towards us; but now God doth not require any ſuch thing as this at your hands, but requires the abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your luſts, and the attending upon him in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and hee requires the keeping of your ſouls under his Word and Conſcience, and the following of the motions of his Spirit, and the beleeving in his Son; ſuch things as theſe the Lord requires, upon which your ſouls may eternally bee ſaved; and will not you accept? well, that ſoul that God intends to ſave, hee will perſwade, and the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſouls in theſe things, that ſo you may bee ſaved in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>The firſt is, If God do but pleaſe to wound his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and terrifie him, hee will ſee all things to bee poor things indeed.</p>
                     <p>Or ſecondly, When God laies his hand upon him in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of him, upon his ſick-bed, or upon his death-bed.

                     <p>A third thing that may make even a carnal heart to ſee all the things of this world to bee as nothing, It is ſtrength of Reaſon; though there ſhould not bee terrour of conſcience, nor any afflictions, yet ſtrength of reaſon may diſcover the gain of this world to bee as nothing, in comparing of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul; and this ſtrength of reaſon God is pleaſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſanctifie by his Spirit, when it is helped by the Word, by the ſanctified reaſon that there is in the Word; I ſay, when it is helped by that, then God bleſſes it ſo as to work off the heart from the world, to the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the everlaſting good of the ſoul; And it is that that I ſhall ſpeak to at this time, to convince you what a poor thing the gain of the world is, even by ſtrength of reaſon, and yet ſuch reaſon as is founded upon the Scripture. —I have already ſhewn you the things that may make a ſpiritual heart ſee a vanity in all things in the world, as the excellency of God, and of Chriſt, and the conſequences of eternity; Now the other two, terrour of conſcience, and afflictions, they are Gods work, and God, when hee pleaſeth to ſhew the vanity of the World, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As Firſt, Surely though thou ſhouldeſt gain the world, and yet bee a man that art like to periſh at laſt, thou haſt gotten but little; and it appears firſt in this, that all thoſe that ever came to have true wiſdome, and that are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commended for men of true wiſdome, they have lookt upon all the things of the world as very poor things: — Firſt, What do you think of him that was the wiſeſt man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth (meer man) even <hi>Solomon?</hi> that had the greateſt experience that ever man had, of what good, the honours, or pleaſures, or profits of the world could do; and yet after

Hee profeſſes that hee did account <hi>all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>But what things were gain to mee, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt, yea doubtleſs, and I account all things but loſs for
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:168883:173"/> the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung,</hi> but doggs-meat, <hi>that I may win Chriſt.</hi> This was the ſleight eſteem that <hi>Paul</hi> had of all the things in the world, that men kept ſuch a ſtir about. — And ſo when God did but begin to work upon <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> when hee did but hear of the ſalvation of his ſoul, when Chriſt did but tell him, <hi>This day is ſalvation come to thy houſe,</hi> preſently, (being a covetous rich man that had gotten his eſtate wrongfully) hee cries out, <hi>The half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have wronged any man by forged cavilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will reſtore fourfold.</hi> And ſo <hi>John</hi> the Beloved Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt, which lay in his boſome, and therefore knew ſo much of the mind of Chriſt, you know what hee ſaith in his firſt <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him: for all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father. The luſt of the fleſh,</hi> that is pleaſures and ſenſuality; <hi>the luſt of the eyes,</hi> that is riches; <hi>and the pride of life,</hi> that is honours; theſe are not of the Father, but of the world, ſaith <hi>John;</hi> you may think they are great matters, they may bee great in your eyes, but <hi>they are not of the Father,</hi> but of the world; <hi>And the world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof; but hee that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.</hi> It were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite to ſhew you this both in Scripture, and likewiſe in the whole courſe of the ſtory of the Church, how ſleightly the Martyrs did account all the things of this world, as ſoon as ever God gave them any true ſpiritual heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but becauſe that would coſt a great deal of time, therefore wee proceed to ſhew by ſtrength of reaſon, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the Scripture; yet this may convince rational men, that that which the wiſeſt men in the world, that have had from God a teſtimony of great wiſdome, have thought to bee a little matter, certainly hath no great matter in it; but they have thought the gain of all the world to bee as nothing; therefore certainly there is no great matter in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:168883:174"/> getting the things of the world, however men eſteem of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What if a man doth gain the world, but loſes his ſoul, he is never a whit the better for any thing in the world; we ſay ſometimes in our common language, ſuch a man is the beſt man in the Pariſh, and I have the hands of the beſt men in the Pariſh; the truth is, wee mean the richeſt men in the Pariſh: but riches and honours make no man one whit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than hee was before:<note place="margin">Prov. 10.20.</note> 
                        <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> Let a man have never ſo great an eſtate, hee may have ſo many houſes that are worth ſo much, but hee is worth no more than hee was; as a great letter makes no more to the ſenſe of a word, than a little letter doth; ſo great honours, and great places, make no more to the excellency of a man, than to bee without them; theſe things in the world they have no goodneſs in them any further than wee put goodneſs upon them; wee may indeed make good uſe of them, and ſo by our good uſe wee may make our ſelves better through Gods Grace; but the poſſeſſing of them doth not make any ſoul one whit better than it was before, they make many ſouls worſe; thouſands of ſouls grow worſe than they were before, by the enjoyment of the world, but where have you one better? none can bee better by the things of the world, no, it muſt bee by ſome grace of God that a ſoul grows better, and not by the things of the world: I will give you for this, this demonſtration, you never finde in Scripture (that I know of) that ever any childe of God was worſe for afflictions in the concluſion, but you may finde, that almoſt every childe of God that was in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was the worſe for their proſperity, there are very few to bee excepted: I confeſs wee read not of <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> and I know not any but thoſe two, but ever were the worſe for their proſperity, but not one worſe for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation;</hi> therefore certainly there is no ſuch great matter in the things of the world; That is a remarkable place wee have in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.21. <hi>And in his eſtate ſhall ſtand up a vile perſon, and hee ſhall obtain
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:168883:174"/> the Kingdome by flatteries.</hi> — A vile perſon, and yet have the honour of the Kingdome, how can this ſtand? yes, it is by interpreters thought to bee <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> hee was advanc'd to that mighty height, that I remember <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Antiq. l. <hi>12.</hi> c. <hi>7</hi>
                        </note> that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in their letter to him give him the Title <hi>of the mighty God;</hi> hee had that title given to him by thoſe that were under him, and <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> which ſignifies illuſtrious; Illuſtrious <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> the Mighty God, and yet the Holy Ghoſt gives him this title, a vile perſon; what good do a few herbs that are ſtrewn upon a Carrion do? do they make the Carrion to bee leſs corrupt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified than it was? truly all the bravery that wicked men have, it is at the beſt but a few herbs and flowers ſtrewn upon a filthy carrion, which makes them not to bee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The things of this world therefore in Scripture are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the things of <hi>another mans,</hi> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.12. <hi>And if you have not been faithful in that which is another mans, who ſhall give you that which is your own?</hi> You may know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by the verſe before: <hi>If therefore yee have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your truſt the true riches?</hi> The riches of this world are called unrighteous Mammon; now theſe are oppoſite to the true riches, as if theſe were not <hi>True</hi> riches, and then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. If you have not been faithful in that which is another mans, that is, in theſe riches of the world, who ſhall give you that which is your own? ſo that nothing is a mans own, to make him better, but grace; the good things of the ſoul, they are a mans own, but the other things they are the worlds things, they are not a mans own; therefore what doth it profit a man that hee hath gained the world? for hee is never a whit the better man.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, All theſe things, they are things beneath the ſoul, things of an inferiour nature; what good is it for a man that hath gotten never ſo much food, that hee hath laid up for his horſes and doggs, but hee hath nothing for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or for himſelf? So if a man hath gotten the world, hee hath gotten ſomewhat for his body, his inferiour part; I but
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:168883:175"/> hee hath gotten nothing for his ſoul that is above it: Theſe are things beneath and under the ſoul: what good would it bee for a ſouldier, if hee have gilt his ſcabbard, but hee hath a broken ruſty ſword within, or but a wooden ſword within? Therefore I finde in Scripture that the bodies of men and women are called the ſheath of their ſouls, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.15. <hi>I Daniel was grieved in my ſpirit, in the midst of my body.</hi> So it is in your books tranſlated, but thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Original Text, they know it is a word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a <hi>ſheath,</hi> and ſo <hi>Arius Montanus</hi> turns it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in your Margents, in the midſt of his <hi>ſheath;</hi> and by comparing this Scripture with another, it is plain, that that is the propriety of the word, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.27. Where the Text ſaith, <hi>The Lord commanded the Angel, and hee put up his ſword again into the ſheath thereof.</hi> Now the word that is here tranſlated <hi>ſheath,</hi> I finde by comparing of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is the very ſame word in the Original that <hi>Daniel</hi> tranſlates body; for the body is but as the ſheath unto the ſoul, and what will it gain a ſouldier to have a brave ſheath, and in the mean time have nothing within it, or that that is of no uſe at all? thus it is with many, they ſeek great things for their bodies, but their ſouls are left in the mean time without any ſuccour or help, and in a moſt miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all things that are in the world ſhould bee ſervants to thy ſoul, for they are all inferiour to it. Wee account it a great diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>onour to a man to marry his ſervant; a man of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in the world, if wee hear hee hath married his ſervant, which is very mean, wee account it a diſhonour: Now for thy heart to mingle it ſelf with the things of this world, as its chiefeſt good, what doſt thou but marry thy ſoul to that which ſhould bee thy ſervant? for all theſe things are but as ſervants to the ſoul; and for the heart of a man to bee ſet upon the things of this world, it is to have the curſe of <hi>Cham</hi> to bee upon him; <hi>A ſervant of ſervants ſhalt thou bee;</hi> for the things of the world they ſhould bee thy ſervants, and thou art their ſervant, and ſo a ſervant of ſervants; the curſe of <hi>Cham</hi> is upon thee, when thou art a ſlave to thy eſtate, or
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:168883:175"/> thy honours, or to thy brutiſh luſts, a ſervant of ſervants art thou.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They are ſuch things as God in his ordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of providence hath denied to the choiceſt of his ſervants, ſpecially in the times of the Goſpel: Many of the choice of his ſervants in former times were in very low and mean conditions; but for the times of the Goſpel, how did Chriſt himſelf, who was the Son of God, live? hee had not <hi>a hole to hide his head in; The fowls of the air had neſts, and the Foxes had holes, but the ſon of man, not whereon to lay his head.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, that was infinitely beloved of the Father; and all the Apoſtles, they were in a poor mean condition, every one of them died a violent death, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>John;</hi> wee have records of their ſeveral ſorts of death, ſome crucified, ſome ſtoned, and ſome other kinds of death, but all put to death, ſave <hi>John,</hi> and read but the latter end of the eleventh of the <hi>Hebrews, Thoſe that the world was not worthy of,</hi> how <hi>they wandered up and down, In ſheep-skins, and goat-skins, and dens, and caves of the earth.</hi> That was a little before Chriſts time, hee ſpeaks of thoſe in the time of the <hi>Macchabes:</hi> Now certainly, if God hath ſo ordered things in his general adminiſtrations, towards ſuch as are moſt dear in his eyes, as to deny them theſe things, that they ſhall have but little of them, there is no great matter in them, ſurely if there were any great matter in them, God would not deny them to his ſervants; when a wicked rich man ſhall look upon a poor man that walks humbly before God, and would not commit the leaſt ſin willingly for a world, meethinks ſuch a man ſhould think thus, Oh Lord! what a difference is there between ſuch a poor man and I, and yet my conſcience tells mee, that God hath more honour from him in one day, than hee hath from mee in all my life; ſurely there is no ſuch great matter in the things of the world, that God hath denied them him: If there were any great matter in them, certainly ſuch as walk moſt humbly with God, and moſt cloſe with God, ſhould have them if they were abſolutely good. — And indeed, this is one great
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:168883:176"/> reaſon that Gods own dear ſervants ſhould have ſo little of the world, and others ſo much, it is, that hee might hold this forth to all the world, that the things of this world have but little in them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, And conſider but the next Argument which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon this, and is of a near kin to it, That all the things of this world, the pleaſures, profits, honours, they ſurely have no great matter in them, for they are no more than may ſtand with Gods eternal hatred of his creature. Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, thoſe things that have no higher excellency in them than may ſtand with the eternal hatred of the Infinite God, certainly they have no great excellency in them; thoſe things that Reprobates may have, ſurely have no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in them, that that you give to your Swine, you make no great matter of it; take all the things of the world, they are no more than God gives to Swine, than God gives to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, than God gives to ſuch as hee doth eternally hate; I remember that <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion as this of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, It is but a crum that the great Maſter of the family caſts to his Dogg: Now if all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire be no more than a bit of bread that you would caſt to your Dogg, then what is <hi>your eſtate?</hi> The Lord who is ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely rich in mercy, hee can afford ſuch bones for Doggs as theſe are, ſurely there is no great matters in theſe things that Reprobates may have as well as children; therefore you that are poor people (and yet godly) that want theſe things, do you quiet your hearts, what though you have not ſuch an eſtate as others? Oh do not murmure! why, it is no great matter you want, you want but that that God gives to Reprobates; Suppoſe a man gains the world, if hee loſe his ſoul, what gets hee? hee gets a bone that Doggs have, for the loſs of his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Take this Argument, That the things of this world, they have no reality in them at all, no real good in them, according to the language of Scripture, what are the things of the world divided into? take the diviſion that you had before of St. <hi>John, The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes,

You hear ſometimes of <hi>Judas</hi>'s ſin, that hee betrayed Chriſt for thirty peeces, a goodly price; I may well apply this to your ſouls, you that venture the loſs of your ſouls for getting the world, though you could poſſibly get all the world, conſidering what hath been ſaid, it is a goodly price; do you not ſee what a goodly price is given for your ſoul? if theſe things bee but made real to you, it would bee of marvelous uſe to help againſt any temptation to any thing of this world.

Now then, theſe things being laid together, you ſee the point cleared, and all that doth remain it is but to binde up this in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Uſes and Applications; If all theſe things bee ſo poor and mean, what uſe are wee to make of all theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Conſiderations?</p>

                     <p>Then for Uſe, If theſe things bee ſo, in the firſt place wee learn, not to envy at the proſperity of ungodly men, whatever it be, let them ruffle it out for a while here in this world, and carry all before them; let man have his day here in this world, there is no great cauſe to envy him, if hee bee going on in ſuch a way as hee is like to loſe his ſoul; poor miſerable wretched creature that hee is, better ten thouſand times hee had never been born: Poor people that are wicked, (as many are) they have the curſe of God mingled in water, and rich men that are wicked, they have the curſe of God like poiſon in their Wine; now wee know, of the twain, the poiſon will work more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Wine, than in Water, and ſo of both, certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly rich men, that have moſt of the world, are the moſt miſerable creatures, for they have more to anſwer for than others have, and their eſtates are uſually fuel for their luſts, and ſo their condition is worſe than the condition of any beggar that begs his bread from door to door; And certainly there is no wicked rich man upon the earth, but if ſo bee that hee dye ſo, hee will hereafter curſe the time that ever hee had an eſtate, and wiſh hee had been a beggar, and gone begging up and down in his raggs, for then hee had not had ſo much to anſwer for before God. O hee is not a man to bee envied at! What man is there that would envy at a malefactour condemned to dye, though hee have on brave cloaths? would not any one of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:168883:180"/> you rather ſave your Ruſſet plain ſuit, or a Leather ſuit, than a ſuit of Velvet, and go to bee executed in it. I have read of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who being invited to a feaſt, as hee was a going, hee met with one a going to execution, and it fell out that the way to execution was a very fair way, but the way that lead him to his friends houſe, it was a dirty Lane, and hee makes this meditation of it, Oh how much better is it to go in this dirty Lane, to go and rejoyce with my friend, than in a fair plain way, and go as the other doth to execution! hee was not willing to go his way, though it were a fair and plain way, but rather to go his own, though a foul and dirty, hee conſidered that the end of the way was different: So do not look much upon men and women, what their preſent condition is, but look what their end is like to bee, and do not envy them. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you cannot but have heard the ſtory of a poor ſouldier, that having a command from his General not to touch any thing upon pain of death, yet coming by a Vine, takes a bunch of Grapes; the General being very ſtrict, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him to dye, becauſe of his diſobedience, and as hee was going to execution, hee went eating the bunch of Grapes; his fellow-ſouldier rebuk'd him, but hee gives him this anſwer, <hi>I pray yee do not envy my Grapes to mee, for they coſt mee dear:</hi> So truly wee have little cauſe to envy the men of the world their Grapes, that they have their mirth, their merry-meetings, whatſoever they have, for it is like to coſt them dear, it is like to coſt them their ſouls, they indanger their eternal periſhing; and therefore there is no cauſe at all to envy ſuch. <hi>David</hi> indeed was troubled a while when hee ſaw the proſperity of the ungodly, but when hee went <hi>into the Sanctuary,</hi>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:168883:180"/> it ſhall bee with thee, as with them, that is, you ſhall have as much as they, and there is all the good you are like ever to have from mee; would you not ſee cauſe to give a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful skreek, if ſuch a meſſage ſhould come from Heaven to you? what a fooliſh thing were it for a childe that hath a loving Father, and a great Inheritance that hee expects from him, becauſe hee ſees a ſtranger that comes and ſits at the Table, and have better proviſion than hee hath, to grumble and grutch, becauſe hee hath not ſuch proviſion made for him every day? Oh hee hath no cauſe to do ſo, for the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is reſerved for him. God, hee is a rich Houſholder, and hee can give ſuch things as theſe are to his enemies, as wee ſpeak of, but the Inheritance is reſerved for thee; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy not the ungodly in the enjoyment of the world, for the truth is, their portion it is but very little, it is but a poor pittance for an immortal ſoul to have, though hee ſhould have all the world. It is true, wee ſhould bee ſenſible of our unworthineſs of the leaſt crum of any good thing, yet though wee ſhould bee ſenſible of our unworthineſs, yet wee ſhould not bee ſatisfied with having all the world for our portion. It was a moſt admirable ſpeech of <hi>Luther,</hi> when divers of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> made much of him, hee began to bee afraid leſt hee ſhould have his portion in theſe outward things, and here ſhould bee all, hee breaks forth in this expreſſion, fearing leſt God ſhould give him his portion here; I did, ſaith hee, proteſt to God with all my power and ſtrength that hee ſhould not put mee off ſo with theſe things, hee would not bee content with them; that is the firſt Uſe; Little cauſe to envy at the men of the world; for the truth is, it is but a poor pittance they have, and they have made a moſt miſerable bargain: If you ſhould ſee one that profeſſes himſelf to be a Merchant, and hee ſhould venture many thouſand pounds, but bring home nothing but a fair painted bauble for children to play with, would you envy it to him? Juſt thus it is with the men of the world, they flatter and pleaſe themſelves with their baubles, but their ſouls are gone in the mean time.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Wherefore in the ſecond place, let all thoſe that do ſeek to get the world in thoſe waies wherein they are like to loſe their ſouls, let them lay this Scripture to heart, and O that God would ſettle it upon their ſpirits, that you might when you awake in the night ſeaſon think of it; when you walk up and down, when you are in your ſhops, in your buſineſs, think but of this Text; I remember I told you in the beginning, of one that counſelled one of the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> to think of this Text a quarter of an hour every day, O that you would every time you awake, eſpecially you that have been ſeeking after much of the world, think ſeriouſly of this Scripture, Am not I the man or woman that have hazarded my ſoul for ſeeking after ſomewhat of the world? haſt thou never ſought to gain any thing of the world in a way of ſin, and to this day thy heart not thorowly humbled for it, nor repented? it may bee not to this day made reſtitution? hath not the eager purſuit after the things of this world taken thy heart up ſo much, that thou haſt not favoured the things of God and eternal life? thou lookeſt upon the things of the world, as if they were the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but for ſpiritual things, they are imaginations; have not the things of this world ſo taken up thy ſpirit, as made thee to have ſleight thoughts of ſpiritual and heavenly things? haſt not thou bleſt thy ſelf in the injoyment of theſe things, though in the mean time God hath not made known to thee the riches of his Kingdome? yet thou haſt thought thy ſelf to have enough in the enjoyment of what thou haſt; haſt not thou often, when thou haſt been at the Word, had thy thoughts and ſpirits about the things of the world, as the things ſuitable to thee, but the things of the Word thou haſt not reliſht? yea and any thing in the Word that hath come cloſe to that covetous corruption of thine, thy heart hath ſecretly derided it; there are no men in the world that do more ſecretly condemn and deride the things of God, ſpiritual things, than worldly-minded men. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.14. wee read that Chriſt preaching to the Phariſees againſt their covetouſneſs, and telling them <hi>That no man could ſerve two

And ſo not onely for Riches, but for thy Credit: Haſt thou not often ventured to lye, to ſave thy credit in ſomething, and haſt been more troubled when thou haſt been diſcovered in any thing that makes againſt thy credit, and eſteem, than in the ſin that thou haſt committed againſt God? Now by ſuch kinde of evidences it is clear, that men injoy the world in ſuch a way, as wherein they are like to loſe their ſouls to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and now, Oh do but look upon your eſtates that you have, and do but think what they coſt you, and little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you will have in them. It is obſerved of <hi>David,</hi> when hee did long for the waters of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and there were men ventured their lives to get him the water; when it came to him, hee would not drink of it, Oh it is the price of blood! ſo when thou lookeſt upon thy eſtate, and fitteſt at thy table, and ſeeſt that thou haſt more there than other men, and lookeſt into thy Cheſt, and there thou haſt plenty of Garments, and thy children are fine and brave, and the like; theſe are pretty things for a while to pleaſe the fancy with, I but what do they coſt? as hee that would reckon
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:168883:182"/> his cloath, hee reckons that the dying and the ſpinning it coſt him ſo much, I but what coſt the wooll? why, that was his own, and hee accounted nothing of that: So, ſuch and ſuch things that thou haſt, what do they coſt? they coſt thus much, and thus much, I but hath not thy ſoul gone into the bargain? and canſt thou have pleaſure in it, when it coſt thee ſo dear as it hath? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.6. the ſpirit of holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> riſes up in indignation againſt ſuch men as theſe are, <hi>I have hated them that regard lying vanities;</hi> My ſpirit cannot but with indignation and abomination riſe up againſt them; what? that men ſhould follow after vanity, when there are ſuch glorious things to bee followed after? when there is the bleſſed God, and the glorious Riches of Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that are revealed in his Word that may take the hearts of the children of men, and yet they follow after vain things; men that have immortal ſouls, capable of eternal communion with the Lord in the higheſt Heavens, for them to follow after vanity, and ſatisfie themſelves in ſuch things, I hate them, ſaith <hi>David;</hi> certainly it is the curſe of God that is upon the hearts of men, that ſuffers them to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch things, and eſpecially in the times of the Goſpel, when ſuch glorious things are revealed to their ſouls, I ſay the curſe of God is upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. <hi>Hee feedeth on Aſhes, a deceived heart hath turned him aſide, that hee cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, is there not a lye in my right hand:</hi> Hee feedeth of Aſhes; A deceived heart hath turned him aſide, that hee cannot deliver his ſoul, there lies the ſore evil of it; <hi>A deceived heart,</hi> hee needs not caſt it upon the Devil, but it is his own bare filthy corrupt heart that dares not truſt God for his ſoul for eternity, hee will have preſent things, come of it what will come; hee knows what the meaning of preſent things are, but what thoſe are that are to come, hee knows not; a deceived heart hath ſeduced him, and hee cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, Is there not a lie in my right hand? that is, is not the ſtrength of my indeavour ſet upon falſhoods? the chief of my ſtrength and indeavours, is it not ſet upon a lie? <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, If
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:168883:182"/> hee were to preach to all the world, hee would chuſe that Text as ſoon as any; <hi>Oh yee children of men, why do yee love vanity, and follow after leaſing?</hi> And it were happy, if it were alwaies ſounding in the ears of every one, whoſe hearts are after preſent things, ſo that ſuch a one may hear a voice behinde him, ſaying, This is not the way, but <hi>this is the way, walk in it:</hi> Thou haſt deceived thy ſoul all this while, and wearied thy ſelf, and that through the curſe of God upon thy heart; as <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Behold, is it not of the Lord of Hoſts, that the people ſhall labour in the very fire, and the people ſhall weary themſelves for very vanity?</hi> Is not this of the Lord of Hoſts? So when wee ſee men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, why they have underſtanding in the things of the world, yet for the matter of God, they have none at all; They are very induſtrious and laborious to get outward things, and outward comforts of this world, and tire themſelves; can ſit up late, and riſe early; Oh is it not of the Lord of Hoſts that people ſhould thus weary and tire themſelves? by way of ſimilitude wee may apply it to the ſpirits of men, that are wearying and tyring of themſelves after vanity; it is the Lords curſe that is upon their hearts. It is ſaid, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> that when hee was upon his ſick-bed, hee hears <hi>Thales</hi> the Philoſopher diſcourſing excellently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout divers excellent moralities, and hee curſes thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights that had taken off his heart from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch things: When thou comeſt upon thy ſick-bed, what will comfort thee then? it cannot bee thy ſilver nor gold; therefore oh that the Lord would make thee now for the preſent to ſee thy vanity and folly before it be too late, and thou curſe thy ſelf, and there bee no hopes for thee! But it is this point ſhews the folly and madneſs of thoſe that ſeek after never ſuch great things in the world with the hazard of their ſouls, but then, what ſhall wee ſay to thoſe that will hazard their ſouls for every trifle? Wee ſpoke of that in the aggravation of the dreadfulneſs of the loſs of the ſoul, onely a word or two more of it here. In <hi>Amos</hi> 2.6. God complains there, that <hi>the righteous were ſold for ſilver,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:168883:183"/> and the poor for a pair of ſhooes:</hi> That they put ſuch a poor price upon righteous men, and upon poor men; as if God ſhould ſay, Know, I put a greater price upon my righteous ſervants, than all the ſilver in the world; Oh now! the complaint may bee againſt many people, that ſell their ſouls for ſilver, yea even for a pair of ſhooes, for a trifle, for a toy, for nothing; not for all the world, but for every little pittance; what is that that thou haſt, or art like to have? why very poor things in compariſon of the world. I remember it is reported of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> a young Gallant, that <hi>Socrates</hi> comes in a jeering way unto him for his pride, and brings him a Map of the world, and ſaith hee to him, Shew mee, I pray thee, where lies thy Land here: Now, if I were to ſpeak to Princes and Emperours, yet this Text would ſpeak dreadfully to them, that they ſhould venture their ſouls for Kingdomes and Empires; but now for you that are never like to have any ſuch things, for you to ſet your hearts upon ſuch trifles, and ſo to damn your ſouls, what can you get? look upon a Map, and ſee what all <hi>England</hi> is: <hi>Europe</hi> is but a fourth part of the world that is known, I but then what is <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Europe,</hi> and then to all the world? and then what is one County in <hi>England,</hi> and one City, or one Houſe? I have a great many Tenements, ſaith one, in a Pariſh, but what is all this to the world, and all this world unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Heaven and the world unto God? but now to think that thou art bleſſed, becauſe thou haſt but a few rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Tenements, Oh what a ſeduced heart hath deceived thee, that thou canſt bee ſatisfied with ſuch things as theſe are? this one meditation mee thinks might ſink into the hearts of thoſe that will venture their ſouls for every trifle: If ever thy ſoul bee ſaved, God muſt ſet ſuch a price upon it, that hee muſt give more than a thouſand worlds are worth to ſave it, hee muſt give no leſs than the blood of his Son; and canſt thou think that the infinite God ſhould prize thy ſoul at ſuch a high rate, when thou thy ſelf doſt prize it at ſuch a low rate? If ſo bee that a man had loſt any thing of his eſtate, and it could not bee redeemed without ſome
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:168883:183"/> great ſumme of mony, If his friends come to know that hee doth not prize what hee hath loſt, will any friend bee ſo mad as to lay down five hundred pound to redeem that for his friend which hee knows aforehand that hee doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, From the conſideration of the compariſon of the gain of the world, to the loſs of the ſoul; It is a Uſe of exhortation, To teach us to anſwer all temptations, or to work this upon our hearts, the anſwering of all temptations to any way of ſin, To anſwer all with this, you offer mee too little, whatſoever you can offer mee, to draw mee to think well of ſin, certainly it is too little, for it indangers my ſoul; the thorow underſtanding of this point, and the working of it upon the heart, is a very great help againſt whatſoever temptation ſhould come to draw thee to ſin.</p>
                     <p>Surely, If theſe things bee ſo, then this can bee no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for mee to neglect any duty that God calls for at my hands, or to venture upon any way that my conſcience tells mee is ſin: Oh but if I do thus, it will indanger my eſtate, but if I do ſuch a thing I ſhall get ſo much by it: Certainly there can bee no ſtrength in this, if what hath been ſpoken out of this Text bee true. But now when there comes a temptation and prevails over thee, thou doſt deny this Scripture to bee the Word of God, and thou ſetteſt thy judgement againſt the truth of God; but now conſider with thy ſelf which is like to ſtand, know, that God will make his Word ſtand, hee will make it good, when thou and a thouſand thouſand ſuch as thou art ſhall periſh for ever; and therefore, as you that are chapmen, when men offer you leſs than your ware is worth, you ſcorn and contemn them; ſo you ſhould do when temptation offers you leſs than your ſoul is worth. Wee read of <hi>Saul,</hi> when hee ſaw the people following <hi>David,</hi> ſaith hee, What can the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> do for you? <hi>Can hee give you Olive-yards and Vine-yards,</hi> and the like? So when temptation to ſin comes, ask it, what can
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:168883:184"/> you do for mee? can you ſave my ſoul in the time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs? you would draw mee to ſuch and ſuch courſes, ſuch and ſuch companions would draw mee to ſuch and ſuch waies, I but you may put them off with this, Is this the way to ſave my ſoul? if it bee, then I will do it, but if it will not do that, God forbid that I ſhould meddle; Oh therefore remember, remember, <hi>that the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.30, 31. The Apoſtle would take off the hearts of men from the things of this world, and bring this Argument, ſaith hee, <hi>The faſhion of this world it paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> Therefore uſe the world, as not abuſing it. That that you have in your Engliſh book, <hi>paſſes away,</hi> it is (<gap reason="foreign">

I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his book about an officious lye, hath this paſſage; ſaith hee, A man muſt not tell an officious lye (that is, a lye without an intention to do any body hurt) for the gaining of the world, nay, for the gaining of all the ſouls in the world, the leaſt ſin is a greater evil, than the gain of all the world is a good, becauſe that it is dangerous to the ſoul, upon that very ground; and therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Baſil,</hi> when the perſecutors terrified him with the loſs of all that hee had, but that did not prevail, then they made him fair proffers, and great advantages that hee ſhould have, I but <hi>Baſil</hi> laught at them, and bid them go and proffer ſuch things to children: So the ſtory of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs tells us of <hi>Auſtinius,</hi> that godly man, that having been a means to demoliſh a place for Idol worſhip, The Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:168883:184"/> afterwards came upon him, and put him to extremity of torments, and ſet children upon him to rake his fleſh with their knives, but at length they would bee content if hee would but give never ſo little for the building up of the Idol Temple again, to let him go free, No, ſaith hee, not one half-penny. Certainly this point will bee enough to juſtifie any that ſhall loſe eſtate, or indure any thing in the world, rather than do any thing that may in the leaſt degree hazard their ſouls: And ſo that Martyreſs <hi>Juletta,</hi> when one accuſed her, and ſaid, that ſhee was a Chriſtian, nay, then ſaith the Judge, you muſt not have liberty of the Law, No, ſaith ſhee, then farewel riches, and life, and all; ſhee would bee ſure to keep her ſoul ſafe, whatſoever became of all other things.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Uſe is an Uſe of Incouragement to thoſe that will rather venture all in the waies of God, than to hazard their ſouls; thou art the <hi>wiſe Merchant,</hi> that art willing <hi>to ſell all for the Pearl,</hi> and bleſs thy ſelf in God for this, that ever God hath put this into thy heart, to look to that which is the main chance, as wee uſe to ſay: If God had left thee to thy ſelf, thou mighteſt have gone on in ſuch waies as others do, but canſt thou ſay, the Lord hath cauſed the fear of himſelf, and the fear of eternity to fall upon my ſoul, and I can appeal to him, that whatever comes of mee in regard of outwards, mee thinks I can bee ſatisfied, ſo bee it all things bee well with my ſoul; I ſay, bleſs thy ſelf in God; a man is not to praiſe himſelf, but in God, that is thus, When thou doſt conſider how God hath drawn thy heart to him, and thy intereſt in God, thou mayeſt bleſs thy ſelf in God, in the grace of God, that hath given thee a heart, taken off from creature-comforts, diſ-ingaged from them, and ſet upon the things that concern the eternal ſalvation of thy ſoul; bleſs thy ſelf in God, and bee not troubled though thou beeſt cut ſhort in the things of this world. One would think that that which hath been ſaid about the vanity of the things of this world, ſhould make people that are croſſed in them (if they bee godly) to bee ſatisfied. What if thou

Juſt thus, for all the world, is the madneſs and folly of people that ſay, they have ſome comfortable hope that God will have mercy upon their ſouls, and will ſave them for ever, yet when they are croſt and wronged, they cry out, they are undone; man and woman thou art not undone, for thy ſoul is ſafe. Lord ſtrike (ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> ſtrike, onely pardon my ſin; And my Brethren, well may you bee incouraged to undergo any difficulties, and to bear the loſs of the comforts of this world, for the ſaving of your ſouls) for indeed the Lord hath granted to us the way of ſalvation of ſouls at an eaſier rate than our Forefathers had; If I ſhould but tell you the way that many of our Forefathers had for the ſaving of their ſouls, and many of the Saints of God in former times, you would have ſaid then that it was a difficult way to ſave ſouls, and go to Heaven: As I will but give you an inſtance of one man, and another woman, how hardly they came to ſalvation. That bleſſed Martyr <hi>Benſeſius,</hi> ſee but what a way hee had to Heaven for profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtian Religion; The Perſecutors came to him,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:168883:185"/> and becauſe hee would not deny the Truth, they ſtrike his body in all his members out if joynt, and when they had done that, they make wounds in all parts of his body, then thirdly, they bring Iron combs ſharpened, and ſo rake upon his body thus wounded, and when they had done that, they laid him upon an Iron grate, and with inſtruments of Iron open thoſe wounds, and after that they melt hot burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalt, and ſtrew it upon thoſe wounds being opened, and then they come with hot Irons; and fear him with thoſe hot Irons, and after that dragg him by the heels into a dungeon, where they had prepared ſharp ſhells, and there hee lay and periſhed; here is one that went to Heaven upon hard terms, you will ſay; but God calls not you to do ſo, but to deny your ſelves in ſome baſe luſt, in ſome ſinful and ungodly way, in ſomething that you may ſpare, that you may ſpare as well as the water out of your ſhooes, as wee uſe to ſay.</p>
                     <p>And then of a woman, that was of Noble birth, and yet ſhee being convented for Religion, and anſwering boldly and reſolutely, and would not yeeld, after many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fair ſpeeches, they dragged her by the hair of the head from the ſeat of Judicature, and having dragged her, they pull off one joynt from another, and having done that, get the teeth and claws of wilde beaſts, and rake her fleſh from the bones, and having afterwards done that, then they came with hot Irons and Torches, and burning flames, one of one ſide, and another of another ſide, and ſcorch and burn her to death in ſuch a way as that was, and yet ſhee goes on conſtantly; ſo bee it ſhee might ſave her ſoul, ſhee was willing to indure all this miſery; wee do not know what God may call you to before you die; many of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have ſuffered very hard things, and God may call you to hard things, Oh that this Text might prepare you! And now my Brethren, as it hath been a means to carry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thorow temptations, and many difficulties in this world, ſo if you would lay but theſe truths to your hearts, and if you cannot think of every particular paſſage, yet do but think of the Text, and take but this one Note, and that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:168883:186"/> is, that whereas God calls others to ſpend their ſtrength in ſuffering ſo great evils, to ſave their ſouls; bee you willing to ſpend the ſtrength that God ſpares you, in doing, in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; ſpend your ſtrength in active obedience ſo much the more, by how much the leſs you are called to ſpend it in the way of paſſive obedience, that ſo you may have cauſe to bleſs God for ever in Heaven, when you ſhall come to ſee ſoul and body to bee bleſſed and ſaved eternally; you may bleſs God for ever in Heaven for revealing ſuch a truth, and ſetting home ſuch a Text; <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, though hee gain the whole world, and loſe his ſoul? and what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi>
